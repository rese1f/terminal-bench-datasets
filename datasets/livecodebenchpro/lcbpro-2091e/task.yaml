      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2091E)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Recently, Misha at the IT Campus "NEIMARK" camp learned a new topic -- the Euclidean algorithm.

      He was somewhat surprised when he realized that $a \cdot b = lcm(a, b) \cdot gcd(a, b)$, where $gcd(a, b)$ -- is [the greatest common divisor (GCD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the numbers $a$ and $b$ and $lcm(a, b)$ -- is [the least common multiple (LCM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple). Misha thought that since the product of LCM and GCD exists, it might be interesting to consider their quotient: $F(a,b)=\frac{lcm(a, b)}{gcd(a, b)}$.

      For example, he took $a = 2$ and $b = 4$, computed $F(2, 4) = \frac{4}{2} = 2$ and obtained a prime number (a number is prime if it has exactly two divisors)! Now he considers $F(a, b)$ to be an interesting ratio if $a < b$ and $F(a, b)$ is a prime number.

      Since Misha has just started studying number theory, he needs your help to calculate -- how many different pairs of numbers $a$ and $b$ are there such that $F(a, b)$ is an interesting ratio and $1 \leq a < b \leq n$?

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^3$). The description of the test cases follows.

      A single line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 10^7$).

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^7$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output the number of interesting ratios $F(a, b)$ for pairs satisfying $1 \leq a < b \leq n$.
