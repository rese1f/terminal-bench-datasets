      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 1993A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Tim is doing a test consisting of $4n$ questions; each question has $4$ options: 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'. For each option, there are exactly $n$ correct answers corresponding to that option -- meaning there are $n$ questions with the answer 'A', $n$ questions with the answer 'B', $n$ questions with the answer 'C', and $n$ questions with the answer 'D'.

      For each question, Tim wrote his answer on the answer sheet. If he could not figure out the answer, he would leave a question mark '?' for that question.

      You are given his answer sheet of $4n$ characters. What is the maximum number of correct answers Tim can get?

      ### Input

      The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) -- the number of test cases.

      The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$).

      The second line of each test case contains a string $s$ of $4n$ characters ($s_i \in \{\texttt{A}, \texttt{B}, \texttt{C}, \texttt{D}, \texttt{?}\}$) -- Tim's answers for the questions.

      ### Output

      For each test case, print a single integer -- the maximum score that Tim can achieve.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      6

      1

      ABCD

      2

      AAAAAAAA

      2

      AAAABBBB

      2

      ????????

      3

      ABCABCABCABC

      5

      ACADC??ACAC?DCAABC?C

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      4
      2
      4
      0
      9
      13
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, there is exactly one question with each answer 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'; so it's possible that Tim gets all his answers correct.

      In the second test case, there are only two correct answers 'A' which makes him get exactly $2$ points in any case.

      In the third test case, Tim can get at most $2$ correct answers with option 'A' and $2$ correct answers with option 'B'. For example, he would get $4$ points if the answers were 'AACCBBDD'.

      In the fourth test case, he refuses to answer any question at all, which makes him get $0$ points.
