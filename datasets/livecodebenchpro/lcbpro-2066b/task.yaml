      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2066B)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      We call a sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ magical if for all $1 \leq i \leq n-1$ it holds that: $\operatorname{min}(a_1, \ldots, a_i) \geq \operatorname{mex}(a_{i+1}, \ldots, a_n)$. In particular, any sequence of length $1$ is considered magical.

      The minimum excluded (MEX) of a collection of integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $t$ which does not occur in the collection $a$.

      You are given a sequence $a$ of $n$ non-negative integers. Find the maximum possible length of a magical subsequence$^{\text{∗}}$ of the sequence $a$.

      $^{\text{∗}}$A sequence $a$ is a subsequence of a sequence $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) -- the length of the sequence $a$.

      The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$) -- the elements of the sequence $a$.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output a single number -- the maximum possible length of a magical subsequence of the sequence $a$.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      8

      5

      4 3 2 1 0

      6

      4 3 3 2 1 0

      4

      2 0 1 2

      1

      777

      4

      1000000000 1 7 9

      2

      0 1

      2

      1 2

      4

      0 1 0 1

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      5
      5
      3
      1
      4
      2
      2
      3
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, the sequence $[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]$ is magical, since:

      - $\operatorname{min}(4) = 4, \operatorname{mex}(3, 2, 1, 0) = 4$. $4 \geq 4$
      - $\operatorname{min}(4, 3) = 3, \operatorname{mex}(2, 1, 0) = 3$. $3 \geq 3$
      - $\operatorname{min}(4, 3, 2) = 2, \operatorname{mex}(1, 0) = 2$. $2 \geq 2$
      - $\operatorname{min}(4, 3, 2, 1) = 1, \operatorname{mex}(0) = 1$. $1 \geq 1$

      In the second test case, the sequence $[4, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0]$ is not magical, since $\operatorname{min}(4, 3) = 3, \operatorname{mex}(3, 2, 1, 0) = 4$, $3 < 4$. However, the subsequence $[4, 3, 2, 1, 0]$ of this sequence is magical, so the answer is $5$.
