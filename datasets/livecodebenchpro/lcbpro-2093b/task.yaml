      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2093B)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      The cost of a positive integer $n$ is defined as the result of dividing the number $n$ by the sum of its digits.

      For example, the cost of the number $104$ is $\frac{104}{1 + 0 + 4} = 20.8$, and the cost of the number $111$ is $\frac{111}{1 + 1 + 1} = 37$.

      You are given a positive integer $n$ that does not contain leading zeros. You can remove any number of digits from the number $n$ (including none) so that the remaining number contains at least one digit and is strictly greater than zero. The remaining digits cannot be rearranged. As a result, you may end up with a number that has leading zeros.

      For example, you are given the number $103554$. If you decide to remove the digits $1$, $4$, and one digit $5$, you will end up with the number $035$, whose cost is $\frac{035}{0 + 3 + 5} = 4.375$.

      What is the minimum number of digits you need to remove from the number so that its cost becomes the minimum possible?

      ### Input

      The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 1000$) -- the number of test cases.

      The only line of each test case contains a positive integer $n$ ($1 \leq n < 10^{100}$) without leading zeros.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output one integer on a new line -- the number of digits that need to be removed from the number so that its cost becomes minimal.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      #### Output #1
