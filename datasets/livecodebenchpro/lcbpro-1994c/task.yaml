      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 1994C)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Yaroslav is playing a computer game, and at one of the levels, he encountered $n$ mushrooms arranged in a row. Each mushroom has its own level of toxicity; the $i$-th mushroom from the beginning has a toxicity level of $a_i$. Yaroslav can choose two integers $1 \le l \le r \le n$, and then his character will take turns from left to right to eat mushrooms from this subsegment one by one, i.e., the mushrooms with numbers $l, l+1, l+2, \ldots, r$.

      The character has a toxicity level $g$, initially equal to $0$. The computer game is defined by the number $x$ -- the maximum toxicity level at any given time. When eating a mushroom with toxicity level $k$, the following happens:

      1. The toxicity level of the character is increased by $k$.
      2. If $g \leq x$, the process continues; otherwise, $g$ becomes zero and the process continues.

      Yaroslav became interested in how many ways there are to choose the values of $l$ and $r$ such that the final value of $g$ is not zero. Help Yaroslav find this number!

      ### Input

      Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^{4}$) -- the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.

      The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $x$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le x \le 10^9$) -- the number of mushrooms and the maximum toxicity level.

      The second line of each test case contains $n$ numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$).

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output a single number -- the number of subsegments such that the final value of $g$ will not be zero.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      5

      4 2

      1 1 1 1

      3 2

      1 2 3

      1 6

      10

      6 3

      1 2 1 4 3 8

      5 999999999

      999999999 999999998 1000000000 1000000000 500000000

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      8
      2
      0
      10
      7
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, the subsegments $(1, 1)$, $(1, 2)$, $(1, 4)$, $(2, 2)$, $(2, 3)$, $(3, 3)$, $(3, 4)$ and $(4, 4)$ are suitable.

      In the second test case, non-zero $g$ will remain only on the subsegments $(1, 1)$ and $(2, 2)$.

      In the third test case, on the only possible subsegment, $g$ will be zero.
