    // The construction strategy aims to satisfy both prefix and suffix conditions simultaneously.
    // It involves setting a block of 1s between y and x, and alternating patterns outside this block.

    // Part 1: Set elements from position y to x (inclusive) to 1.
    // In 0-based indexing, this corresponds to indices from y_idx to x_idx.
    // This block of 1s ensures that the prefix sum increases steadily from index y_idx to x_idx, helping make P_x the maximum.
    // Similarly, it ensures that suffix sums (when considered right-to-left) increase steadily from x_idx down to y_idx, helping make S_y the maximum.

    // The required pattern for this segment is an alternating sequence of 1s and -1s,
    // specifically designed such that it ends with -1 at index y_idx-1 (position y-1).
    // The pattern is ..., 1, -1.
    // This check handles the edge case where y = 1 (y_idx = 0), which means this segment is empty.
    if (y_idx > 0) { 
        // Set the element at index y_idx-1 (which corresponds to position y-1) to -1.
        // This is the rightmost element of this segment.
        a[y_idx - 1] = -1; 
        
        // Fill the remaining elements to the left (indices from y_idx-2 down to 0)
        // using the alternating pattern rule: a[i] = -a[i+1].
        for (int i = y_idx - 2; i >= 0; --i) {

            // This propagates the alternating pattern leftwards.
            a[i] = -a[i + 1];
        }
    }

    // Part 3: Set elements after position x (indices x_idx+1 to n-1).
    // The required pattern for this segment is an alternating sequence of -1s and 1s,
    // specifically designed such that it starts with -1 at index x_idx+1 (position x+1).
