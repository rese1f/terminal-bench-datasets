    // The problem asks for a non-negative integer k <= 10^18 such that
    // the condition (x+k) + (y+k) == (x+k) ^ (y+k) holds.
    // Here, '+' denotes standard addition and '^' denotes bitwise XOR.

    // We use the property that for any non-negative integers A and B,
    // A + B = A ^ B + 2 * (A & B), where '&' is bitwise AND.
    // The given condition (x+k) + (y+k) == (x+k) ^ (y+k) is thus equivalent to
    // 2 * ((x+k) & (y+k)) == 0, which simplifies to (x+k) & (y+k) == 0.
    // So, we need to find a non-negative integer k such that the bitwise AND
    // of (x+k) and (y+k) is zero.

    // Check if k=0 is a valid solution.
    // If k=0, the condition becomes (x+0) & (y+0) == 0, which is x & y == 0.
    // If x & y == 0, then k=0 is a valid solution. Since we need to find *any* non-negative k,
    // and k=0 is the smallest possible non-negative value, it's a perfect candidate.

    // If x == y, the condition becomes (x+k) & (x+k) == 0.
    // Since A & A = A for any A, this means x+k == 0.
    // However, we are given that x and y are positive integers (x, y >= 1).
    // And k must be non-negative (k >= 0).
    // Therefore, x+k >= 1 + 0 = 1. So x+k can never be 0.
    // Thus, if x == y (and x >= 1), no solution exists.

    // Now consider the case where x != y and x & y != 0. We need to find a k > 0.
    // A strategy is derived based on setting one of (x+k) or (y+k) to a power of 2.
    // Let target = max(x, y).
    // Find the smallest power of 2, let's call it `pow2`, such that `pow2 >= target`.
    // Let's define a candidate k based on this `pow2`.
    // If x >= y, we set A = x+k = pow2. This means k = pow2 - x. Then B = y+k = y + pow2 - x.
    // We need to check if A & B = pow2 & (y + pow2 - x) == 0.
    // This is equivalent to checking pow2 & (pow2 - (x-y)) == 0.
    // Let D = x-y. Since x > y, D > 0. We check pow2 & (pow2 - D) == 0.
    // A property of powers of 2 states that for $P=2^p$, $P \& (P-D) = 0$ if $0 < D \le P$.
    // Since pow2 is the smallest power of 2 >= x, and x > y >= 1, we have x-y < x <= pow2.
    // Thus D = x-y satisfies $0 < D < pow2$. The condition holds.
    //
    // If y > x, we set B = y+k = pow2. This means k = pow2 - y. Then A = x+k = x + pow2 - y.
    // We need to check if A & B = (x + pow2 - y) & pow2 == 0.
    // This is equivalent to checking (pow2 - (y-x)) & pow2 == 0.
    // Let D = y-x. Since y > x, D > 0. We check (pow2 - D) & pow2 == 0.
    // Since pow2 is the smallest power of 2 >= y, and y > x >= 1, we have y-x < y <= pow2.
    // Thus D = y-x satisfies $0 < D < pow2$. The condition holds.
    
    // In both cases (x > y and y > x), the derived k works.
    // k = pow2 - max(x, y) is always non-negative because pow2 >= max(x, y).
    // The constraints on x, y (<= 10^9, approx 2^30) ensure pow2 will be at most 2^30.
