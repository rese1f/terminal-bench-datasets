      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2004E)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Two players, Alice and Bob, are playing a game. They have $n$ piles of stones, with the $i$-th pile initially containing $a_i$ stones.

      On their turn, a player can choose any pile of stones and take any positive number of stones from it, with one condition:

      - let the current number of stones in the pile be $x$. It is not allowed to take from the pile a number of stones $y$ such that the greatest common divisor of $x$ and $y$ is not equal to $1$.

      The player who cannot make a move loses. Both players play optimally (that is, if a player has a strategy that allows them to win, no matter how the opponent responds, they will win). Alice goes first.

      Determine who will win.

      ### Input

      The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.

      Each test case consists of two lines:

      - the first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$);
      - the second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^7$).

      Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output Alice if Alice wins, or Bob if Bob wins.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      3

      3

      3 2 9

      4

      3 3 6 1

      5

      1 2 3 4 5

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      Bob
      Alice
      Bob
      ```
