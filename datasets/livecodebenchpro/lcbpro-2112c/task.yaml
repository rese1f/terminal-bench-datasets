      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2112C)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Alice and Bob are playing a game using an integer array $a$ of size $n$.

      Initially, all elements of the array are colorless. First, Alice chooses $3$ elements and colors them red. Then Bob chooses any element and colors it blue (if it was red -- recolor it). Alice wins if the sum of the red elements is strictly greater than the value of the blue element.

      Your task is to calculate the number of ways that Alice can choose $3$ elements in order to win regardless of Bob's actions.

      ### Input

      The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) -- the number of test cases.

      The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 5000$).

      The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_1 \le a_2 \le \cdots \le a_n \le 10^5$).

      Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $5000$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, print a single integer -- the number of ways that Alice can choose $3$ elements in order to win regardless of Bob's actions.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      6

      3

      1 2 3

      4

      1 1 2 4

      5

      7 7 7 7 7

      5

      1 1 2 2 4

      6

      2 3 3 4 5 5

      5

      1 1 1 1 3

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      0
      0
      10
      2
      16
      0
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first two test cases, no matter which three elements Alice chooses, Bob will be able to paint one element blue so that Alice does not win.

      In the third test case, Alice can choose any three elements. If Bob colors one of the red elements, the sum of red elements will be $14$, and the sum of blue elements will be $7$. If Bob chooses an uncolored element, the sum of red elements will be $21$, and the sum of blue elements will be $7$.

      In the fourth test case, Alice can choose either the $1$-st, $3$-rd and $4$-th element, or the $2$-nd, $3$-rd and $4$-th element.
