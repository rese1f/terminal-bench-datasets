      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 1988B)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      You are given a sequence $[a_1,\ldots,a_n]$ where each element $a_i$ is either $0$ or $1$. You can apply several (possibly zero) operations to the sequence. In each operation, you select two integers $1\le l\le r\le |a|$ (where $|a|$ is the current length of $a$) and replace $[a_l,\ldots,a_r]$ with a single element $x$, where $x$ is the majority of $[a_l,\ldots,a_r]$.

      Here, the majority of a sequence consisting of $0$ and $1$ is defined as follows: suppose there are $c_0$ zeros and $c_1$ ones in the sequence, respectively.

      - If $c_0\ge c_1$, the majority is $0$.
      - If $c_0<c_1$, the majority is $1$.

      For example, suppose $a=[1,0,0,0,1,1]$. If we select $l=1,r=2$, the resulting sequence will be $[0,0,0,1,1]$. If we select $l=4,r=6$, the resulting sequence will be $[1,0,0,1]$.

      Determine if you can make $a=[1]$ with a finite number of operations.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 4\cdot 10^4$). Description of the test cases follows.

      The first line of each testcase contains one integer $n$ ($1\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$).

      The second line of each testcase contains a string consisting of $0$ and $1$, describing the sequence $a$.

      It's guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all testcases does not exceed $2\cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each testcase, if it's possible to make $a=[1]$, print YES. Otherwise, print NO. You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will be recognized as positive responses.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      5

      1

      0

      1

      1

      2

      01

      9

      100000001

      9

      000011000

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      No
      Yes
      No
      Yes
      No
      ```

      ### Note

      In the fourth testcase of the example, initially $a=[1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1]$. A valid sequence of operations is:

      1. Select $l=2,r=8$ and apply the operation. $a$ becomes $[1,0,1]$.
      2. Select $l=1,r=3$ and apply the operation. $a$ becomes $[1]$.
