      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2062C)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Cirno has a sequence $a$ of length $n$. She can perform either of the following two operations for any (possibly, zero) times unless the current length of $a$ is $1$:

      - Reverse the sequence. Formally, $[a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n]$ becomes $[a_n,a_{n-1},\ldots,a_1]$ after the operation.
      - Replace the sequence with its difference sequence. Formally, $[a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n]$ becomes $[a_2-a_1,a_3-a_2,\ldots,a_n-a_{n-1}]$ after the operation.

      Find the maximum possible sum of elements of $a$ after all operations.

      ### Input

      The first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$) -- the number of input test cases.

      The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1\le n\le 50$) -- the length of sequence $a$.

      The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ ($|a_i|\le 1000$) -- the sequence $a$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, print an integer representing the maximum possible sum.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      5

      1

      -1000

      2

      5 -3

      2

      1000 1

      9

      9 7 9 -9 9 -8 7 -8 9

      11

      678 201 340 444 453 922 128 987 127 752 0

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      -1000
      8
      1001
      2056
      269891
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, Cirno can not perform any operation, so the answer is $-1000$.

      In the second test case, Cirno firstly reverses the sequence, then replaces the sequence with its difference sequence: $[5,-3]\to[-3,5]\to[8]$. It can be proven that this maximizes the sum, so the answer is $8$.

      In the third test case, Cirno can choose not to operate, so the answer is $1001$.
