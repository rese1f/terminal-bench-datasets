      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2077D)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Given an array $a$ of length $n$, determine the lexicographically largest$^{\text{∗}}$ subsequence$^{\text{†}}$ $s$ of $a$ such that $s$ can be the side lengths of a polygon.

      Recall that $s$ can be the side lengths of a polygon if and only if $|s| \geq 3$ and



      $$ 2 \cdot \max(s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_{|s|}) < s_1 + s_2 + \ldots + s_{|s|}. $$

      If no such subsequence $s$ exists, print $-1$.

      $^{\text{∗}}$A sequence $x$ is lexicographically smaller than a sequence $y$ if and only if one of the following holds:

      - $x$ is a prefix of $y$, but $x \ne y$;
      - in the first position where $x$ and $y$ differ, the sequence $x$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $y$.

      $^{\text{†}}$A sequence $x$ is a subsequence of a sequence $y$ if $x$ can be obtained from $y$ by deleting several (possibly zero or all) elements.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) -- the length of the array $a$.

      The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$) -- the array $a$.

      It is guaranteed that the total sum of all values of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output the answer in the following format:

      If the answer exists, output the following.

      In the first line, output the integer $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq n$) -- the length of the subsequence $s$.

      In the second line, output $k$ integers $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k$ ($1 \leq s_i \leq 10^9$, $s$ is a subsequence of $a$) -- the subsequence $s$. Note that the desired output is the value, not the index.

      Otherwise, output a single line with the integer $-1$.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      5

      3

      3 1 2

      4

      1 4 2 3

      6

      1 6 4 5 3 2

      6

      43 12 99 53 22 4

      7

      9 764 54 73 22 23 1

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      -1
      3
      4 2 3
      4
      6 5 3 2
      5
      43 99 53 22 4
      4
      54 73 23 1
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, there are no subsequences that can be the side lengths of a polygon.

      In the second test case, there are $2$ subsequences that can be the side lengths of a polygon: $1, 4, 2, 3$ and $4, 2, 3$. The latter is the lexicographically larger subsequence.
