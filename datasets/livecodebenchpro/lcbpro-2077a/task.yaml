      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2077A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      [Breach of Faith - Supire feat.eili](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVTiCKIIQSM)

      You and your team have worked tirelessly until you have a sequence $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n+1}$ of positive integers satisfying these properties.

      - $1 \le a_i \le 10^{18}$ for all $1 \le i \le 2n + 1$.
      - $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_{2n+1}$ are pairwise distinct.
      - $a_1 = a_2 - a_3 + a_4 - a_5 + \ldots + a_{2n} - a_{2n+1}$.

      However, the people you worked with sabotaged you because they wanted to publish this sequence first. They deleted one number from this sequence and shuffled the rest, leaving you with a sequence $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{2n}$. You have forgotten the sequence $a$ and want to find a way to recover it.

      If there are many possible sequences, you can output any of them. It can be proven under the constraints of the problem that at least one sequence $a$ exists.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$).

      The second line of each test case contains $2n$ distinct integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_{2n}$ ($1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9$), denoting the sequence $b$.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output $2n+1$ distinct integers, denoting the sequence $a$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^{18}$).

      If there are multiple possible sequences, you can output any of them. The sequence $a$ should satisfy the given conditions, and it should be possible to obtain $b$ after deleting one element from $a$ and shuffling the remaining elements.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      4

      1

      9 2

      2

      8 6 1 4

      3

      99 2 86 33 14 77

      2

      1 6 3 2

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      7 9 2
      1 8 4 6 9
      86 99 2 77 69 14 33
      4 6 1 2 3
      ```
