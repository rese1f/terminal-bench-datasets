      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2069E)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      You are given a string $s$ consisting of characters A and B.

      Your task is to split it into blocks of length $1$ and $2$ in such a way that

      - there are no more than $a$ strings equal to "A";
      - there are no more than $b$ strings equal to "B";
      - there are no more than $ab$ strings "AB";
      - there are no more than $ba$ strings "BA";

      Strings "AA" and "BB" are prohibited. Each character of the initial string $s$ should belong to exactly one block.

      ### Input

      The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases. Next, $t$ independent cases follow.

      The first line of each test case contains a single string $s$ ($1 \le |s| \le 5 \cdot 10^5$) consisting only of characters A and/or B.

      The second line of each test case contains four integers $a$, $b$, $ab$, and $ba$ ($0 \le a, b, ab, ba \le 5 \cdot 10^5$) -- the maximum allowed number of strings "A", "B", "AB", and "BA" correspondingly.

      It's guaranteed that the total length of $s$ doesn't exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$ over all test cases.

      ### Output

      For each test case, print YES if it's possible to split string $s$. Otherwise, print NO.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      7

      A

      0 0 10 10

      B

      0 1 0 0

      ABA

      0 0 1 1

      ABBABAAB

      5 5 0 0

      ABABBAABBAAB

      1 1 2 3

      ABBBBAB

      0 3 2 0

      BAABBA

      1 3 2 0

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      NO
      YES
      NO
      YES
      YES
      YES
      NO
      ```

      ### Note

      In the third test case, all possible splits are: A\|B\|A, AB\|A or A\|BA. All of them have at least one "A".

      In the fourth test case, one of the possible splits is the following: A\|B\|B\|A\|B\|A\|A\|B.

      In the fifth test case, one of the possible splits is the following: A\|BA\|B\|BA\|AB\|BA\|AB.
