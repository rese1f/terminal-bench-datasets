      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2092A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Kamilka has a flock of $n$ sheep, the $i$-th of which has a beauty level of $a_i$. All $a_i$ are distinct. Morning has come, which means they need to be fed. Kamilka can choose a non-negative integer $d$ and give each sheep $d$ bunches of grass. After that, the beauty level of each sheep increases by $d$.

      In the evening, Kamilka must choose exactly two sheep and take them to the mountains. If the beauty levels of these two sheep are $x$ and $y$ (after they have been fed), then Kamilka's pleasure from the walk is equal to $\gcd(x, y)$, where $\gcd(x, y)$ denotes the [greatest common divisor (GCD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of integers $x$ and $y$.

      The task is to find the maximum possible pleasure that Kamilka can get from the walk.

      ### Input

      Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 500$), the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

      The first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 100$), the number of sheep Kamilka has.

      The second line of each test case contains $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \ (1 \le a_i \le 10^9)$ -- the beauty levels of the sheep.

      It is guaranteed that all $a_i$ are distinct.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum possible pleasure that Kamilka can get from the walk.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      4

      2

      1 3

      5

      5 4 3 2 1

      3

      5 6 7

      3

      1 11 10

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      2
      4
      2
      10
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, $d=1$ works. In this case, the pleasure is $\gcd(1+1, \ 1+3)=\gcd(2, \ 4)=2$. It can be shown that a greater answer cannot be obtained.

      In the second test case, let's take $d=3$. In this case, the pleasure is $\gcd(1+3, \ 5+3)=\gcd(4, \ 8)=4$. Thus, for this test case, the answer is $4$.
