      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2063A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Today, Little John used all his savings to buy a segment. He wants to build a house on this segment.

      A segment of positive integers $[l,r]$ is called coprime if $l$ and $r$ are coprime$^{\text{∗}}$.

      A coprime segment $[l,r]$ is called minimal coprime if it does not contain$^{\text{†}}$ any coprime segment not equal to itself. To better understand this statement, you can refer to the notes.

      Given $[l,r]$, a segment of positive integers, find the number of minimal coprime segments contained in $[l,r]$.

      $^{\text{∗}}$Two integers $a$ and $b$ are coprime if they share only one positive common divisor. For example, the numbers $2$ and $4$ are not coprime because they are both divided by $2$ and $1$, but the numbers $7$ and $9$ are coprime because their only positive common divisor is $1$.

      $^{\text{†}}$A segment $[l',r']$ is contained in the segment $[l,r]$ if and only if $l \le l' \le r' \le r$.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The only line of each test case consists of two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \le l \le r \le 10^9$).

      ### Output

      For each test case, output the number of minimal coprime segments contained in $[l,r]$, on a separate line.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      6

      1 2

      1 10

      49 49

      69 420

      1 1

      9982 44353

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      1
      9
      0
      351
      1
      34371
      ```

      ### Note

      On the first test case, the given segment is $[1,2]$. The segments contained in $[1,2]$ are as follows.

      - $[1,1]$: This segment is coprime, since the numbers $1$ and $1$ are coprime, and this segment does not contain any other segment inside. Thus, $[1,1]$ is minimal coprime.
      - $[1,2]$: This segment is coprime. However, as it contains $[1,1]$, which is also coprime, $[1,2]$ is not minimal coprime.
      - $[2,2]$: This segment is not coprime because $2$ and $2$ share $2$ positive common divisors: $1$ and $2$.

      Therefore, the segment $[1,2]$ contains $1$ minimal coprime segment.
