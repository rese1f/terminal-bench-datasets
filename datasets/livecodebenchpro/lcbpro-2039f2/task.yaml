      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2039F2)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      This is the hard version of the problem. The only differences between the two versions of this problem are the constraints on $t$, $m$, and the sum of $m$. You can only make hacks if both versions of the problem are solved.

      For an integer array $a$ of length $n$, define $f(k)$ as the [greatest common divisor (GCD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the maximum values of all subarrays$^{\text{∗}}$ of length $k$. For example, if the array is $[2, 1, 4, 6, 2]$, then $f(3) = \operatorname{gcd}(\operatorname{max}([2, 1, 4]), \operatorname{max}([1, 4, 6]), \operatorname{max}([4, 6, 2])) = \operatorname{gcd}(4, 6, 6) = 2$.

      An array is good if $f(i) \neq f(j)$ is satisfied over all pairs $1 \le i \lt j \le n$.

      Shohag has an integer $m$. Help him count the number, modulo $998\,244\,353$, of non-empty good arrays of arbitrary length such that each element of the array is an integer from $1$ to $m$.

      $^{\text{∗}}$An array $d$ is a subarray of an array $c$ if $d$ can be obtained from $c$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

      ### Input

      The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^5$) -- the number of test cases.

      The first and only line of each test case contains an integer $m$ ($1 \le m \le 10^6$).

      Note that there is no limit on the sum of $m$ over all test cases.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output an integer -- the number of valid arrays modulo $998\,244\,353$.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      3

      2

      5

      9

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      4
      29
      165
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, the valid arrays are $[1]$, $[1, 2]$, $[2]$, and $[2, 1]$.

      In the second test case, there are a total of $29$ valid arrays. In particular, the array $[2, 1, 4]$ with length $n = 3$ is valid because all elements are from $1$ to $m = 5$ and $f(1)$, $f(2)$ and $f(n = 3)$ all are distinct:

      - $f(1) = \operatorname{gcd}(\operatorname{max}([2]), \operatorname{max}([1]), \operatorname{max}([4])) = \operatorname{gcd}(2, 1, 4) = 1.$
      - $f(2) = \operatorname{gcd}(\operatorname{max}([2, 1]), \operatorname{max}([1, 4])) = \operatorname{gcd}(2, 4) = 2.$
      - $f(3) = \operatorname{gcd}(\operatorname{max}([2, 1, 4])) = \operatorname{gcd}(4) = 4.$
