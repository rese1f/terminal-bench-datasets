      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 1996A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      It's another beautiful day on Farmer John's farm.

      After Farmer John arrived at his farm, he counted $n$ legs. It is known only chickens and cows live on the farm, and a chicken has $2$ legs while a cow has $4$.

      What is the minimum number of animals Farmer John can have on his farm assuming he counted the legs of all animals?

      ### Input

      The first line contains single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^3$)Â -- the number of test cases.

      Each test case contains an integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^3$, $n$ is even).

      ### Output

      For each test case, output an integer, the minimum number of animals Farmer John can have on his farm.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      3

      2

      6

      8

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      1
      2
