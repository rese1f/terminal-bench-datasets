      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 1988C)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      You are given a positive integer $n$. Find the longest sequence of positive integers $a=[a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k]$ that satisfies the following conditions, and print the sequence:

      - $a_i\le n$ for all $1\le i\le k$.
      - $a$ is strictly increasing. That is, $a_i>a_{i-1}$ for all $2\le i\le k$.
      - $a_i\,|\,a_{i-1}=n$ for all $2\le i\le k$, where $|$ denotes the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR).

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$). Description of the test cases follows.

      The only line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($1\le n\le 10^{18}$).

      It's guaranteed that the sum of lengths of the longest valid sequences does not exceed $5\cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each testcase, print two lines. In the first line, print the length of your constructed sequence, $k$. In the second line, print $k$ positive integers, denoting the sequence. If there are multiple longest sequences, you can print any of them.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      4

      1

      3

      14

      23

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      1
      1
      3
      1 2 3
      4
      4 10 12 14
      5
      7 18 21 22 23```
