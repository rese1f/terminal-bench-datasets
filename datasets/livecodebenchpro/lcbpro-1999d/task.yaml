      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 1999D)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Slavic has a very tough exam and needs your help in order to pass it. Here is the question he is struggling with:

      There exists a string $s$, which consists of lowercase English letters and possibly zero or more "?".

      Slavic is asked to change each "?" to a lowercase English letter such that string $t$ becomes a subsequence (not necessarily continuous) of the string $s$.

      Output any such string, or say that it is impossible in case no string that respects the conditions exists.

      ### Input

      The first line contains a single integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.

      The first line of each test case contains a single string $s$ ($1 \leq |s| \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$, and $s$ consists only of lowercase English letters and "?"-s)  -- the original string you have.

      The second line of each test case contains a single string $t$ ($1 \leq |t| \leq |s|$, and $t$ consists only of lowercase English letters)  -- the string that should be a subsequence of string $s$.

      The sum of $|s|$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$, where $|x|$ denotes the length of the string $x$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, if no such string exists as described in the statement, output "NO" (without quotes).

      Otherwise, output "YES" (without quotes). Then, output one line -- the string that respects all conditions.

      You can output "YES" and "NO" in any case (for example, strings "yEs", "yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive response).

      If multiple answers are possible, you can output any of them.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      5

      ?????

      xbx

      ab??e

      abcde

      ayy?x

      a

      ab??e

      dac

      paiu

      mom

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      YES
      xabax
      YES
      abcde
      YES
      ayyyx
      NO
      NO
      ```
