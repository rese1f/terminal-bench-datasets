      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2107B)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Tom and Jerry found some apples in the basement. They decided to play a game to get some apples.

      There are $n$ boxes, and the $i$-th box has $a_i$ apples inside. Tom and Jerry take turns picking up apples. Tom goes first. On their turn, they have to do the following:

      - Choose a box $i$ ($1 \le i \le n$) with a positive number of apples, i.e. $a_i > 0$, and pick $1$ apple from this box. Note that this reduces $a_i$ by $1$.
      - If no valid box exists, the current player loses.
      - If after the move, $\max(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) - \min(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) > k$ holds, then the current player (who made the last move) also loses.

      If both players play optimally, predict the winner of the game.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The first line of each test case contains two integers $n,k$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5,1\le k \le 10^9$).

      The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$).

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, print "Tom" (without quotes) if Tom will win, or "Jerry" (without quotes) otherwise.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      3

      3 1

      2 1 2

      3 1

      1 1 3

      2 1

      1 4

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      Tom
      Tom
      Jerry
      ```

      ### Note

      Note that neither player is necessarily playing an optimal strategy in the following games, just to give you an idea of how the game is going.

      In the first test case of the example, one possible situation is shown as follows.

      - Tom takes an apple from the first box. The array $a$ becomes $[1, 1, 2]$. Tom does not lose because $\max(1, 1, 2) - \min(1, 1, 2) = 1 \le k$.
      - Jerry takes an apple from the first box as well. The array $a$ becomes $[0, 1, 2]$. Jerry loses because $\max(0, 1, 2) - \min(0, 1, 2) = 2 > k$.
