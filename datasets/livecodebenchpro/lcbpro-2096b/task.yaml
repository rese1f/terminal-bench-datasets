      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2096B)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      You are the proud owner of many colorful gloves, and you keep them in a drawer. Each glove is in one of $n$ colors numbered $1$ to $n$. Specifically, for each $i$ from $1$ to $n$, you have $l_i$ left gloves and $r_i$ right gloves with color $i$.

      Unfortunately, it's late at night, so you can't see any of your gloves. In other words, you will only know the color and the type (left or right) of a glove after you take it out of the drawer.

      A matching pair of gloves with color $i$ consists of exactly one left glove and one right glove with color $i$. Find the minimum number of gloves you need to take out of the drawer to guarantee that you have at least $k$ matching pairs of gloves with different colors.

      Formally, find the smallest positive integer $x$ such that:

      - For any set of $x$ gloves you take out of the drawer, there will always be at least $k$ matching pairs of gloves with different colors.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) -- the number of different colors, and the minimum number of required matching pairs of gloves.

      The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_n$ ($1 \leq l_i \leq 10^9$) -- the number of left gloves with color $i$ for each $i$ from $1$ to $n$.

      The third line of each test case contains $n$ integers $r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n$ ($1 \leq r_i \leq 10^9$) -- the number of right gloves with color $i$ for each $i$ from $1$ to $n$.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output a single integer -- the minimum number of gloves you need to take out of the drawer.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      5

      3 3

      1 1 1

      1 1 1

      1 1

      100

      1

      3 2

      100 1 1

      200 1 1

      5 2

      97 59 50 87 36

      95 77 33 13 74

      10 6

      97 59 50 87 36 95 77 33 13 74

      91 14 84 33 54 89 68 34 14 15

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      6
      101
      303
      481
      1010
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, you must take out all of the gloves, so the answer is $6$.

      In the second test case, the answer is $101$. If you take out $100$ gloves or fewer, then it is possible that all of them are left gloves, which means you won't have a matching pair of gloves.

      In the third test case, the answer is $303$. If you only take out $302$ gloves, then one possible scenario is as follows:

      - Color $1$: $100$ left gloves, $200$ right gloves
      - Color $2$: $1$ left glove, $0$ right gloves
      - Color $3$: $0$ left gloves, $1$ right glove

      You only have multiple matching pairs of gloves with color $1$. So you won't have at least $2$ matching pairs of gloves with different colors.
