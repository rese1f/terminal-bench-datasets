      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2035A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Red was ejected. They were not the imposter.

      There are $n$ rows of $m$ people. Let the position in the $r$-th row and the $c$-th column be denoted by $(r, c)$. Number each person starting from $1$ in row-major order, i.e., the person numbered $(r-1)\cdot m+c$ is initially at $(r,c)$.

      The person at $(r, c)$ decides to leave. To fill the gap, let the person who left be numbered $i$. Each person numbered $j>i$ will move to the position where the person numbered $j-1$ is initially at. The following diagram illustrates the case where $n=2$, $m=3$, $r=1$, and $c=2$.

      ![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/b24389738aac41115cbf116d0cb49065a5710c74.png)

      Calculate the sum of the Manhattan distances of each person's movement. If a person was initially at $(r_0, c_0)$ and then moved to $(r_1, c_1)$, the Manhattan distance is $|r_0-r_1|+|c_0-c_1|$.

      ### Input

      The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\le t\le 10^4$)Â -- the number of test cases.

      The only line of each testcase contains $4$ integers $n$, $m$, $r$, and $c$ ($1\le r\le n\le 10^6$, $1 \le c \le m \le 10^6$), where $n$ is the number of rows, $m$ is the number of columns, and $(r,c)$ is the position where the person who left is initially at.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output a single integer denoting the sum of the Manhattan distances.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      4

      2 3 1 2

      2 2 2 1

      1 1 1 1

      1000000 1000000 1 1

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      6
      1
      0
      1999998000000
      ```

      ### Note

      For the first test case, the person numbered $2$ leaves, and the distances of the movements of the person numbered $3$, $4$, $5$, and $6$ are $1$, $3$, $1$, and $1$, respectively. So the answer is $1+3+1+1=6$.

      For the second test case, the person numbered $3$ leaves, and the person numbered $4$ moves. The answer is $1$.
