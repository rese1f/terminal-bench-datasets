      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2033A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Sakurako and Kosuke decided to play some games with a dot on a coordinate line. The dot is currently located in position $x=0$. They will be taking turns, and Sakurako will be the one to start.

      On the $i$-th move, the current player will move the dot in some direction by $2\cdot i-1$ units. Sakurako will always be moving the dot in the negative direction, whereas Kosuke will always move it in the positive direction.

      In other words, the following will happen:

      1. Sakurako will change the position of the dot by $-1$, $x = -1$ now
      2. Kosuke will change the position of the dot by $3$, $x = 2$ now
      3. Sakurako will change the position of the dot by $-5$, $x = -3$ now
      4. $\cdots$

      They will keep on playing while the absolute value of the coordinate of the dot does not exceed $n$. More formally, the game continues while $-n\le x\le n$. It can be proven that the game will always end.

      Your task is to determine who will be the one who makes the last turn.

      ### Input

      The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1\le t\le 100$) -- the number of games that Sakurako and Kosuke played.

      Each game is described by one number $n$ ($1 \le n\le 100$) -- the number that defines the condition when the game ends.

      ### Output

      For each of the $t$ games, output a line with the result of that game. If Sakurako makes the last turn, output "Sakurako" (without quotes); else output "Kosuke".

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      4

      1

      6

      3

      98

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      Kosuke
      Sakurako
      Kosuke
      Sakurako
      ```
