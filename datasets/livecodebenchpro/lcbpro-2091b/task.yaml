      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2091B)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      At the IT Campus "NEIMARK", there are training sessions in competitive programming -- both individual and team-based!

      For the next team training session, $n$ students will attend, and the skill of the $i$-th student is given by a positive integer $a_i$.

      The coach considers a team strong if its strength is at least $x$. The strength of a team is calculated as the number of team members multiplied by the minimum skill among the team members.

      For example, if a team consists of $4$ members with skills $[5, 3, 6, 8]$, then the team's strength is $4 \cdot min([5, 3, 6, 8]) = 12$.

      Output the maximum possible number of strong teams, given that each team must have at least one participant and every participant must belong to exactly one team.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \leq x \leq 10^9$) -- the number of students in training and the minimum strength of a team to be considered strong.

      The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$) -- the skill of each student.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output the maximum possible number of teams with strength at least $x$.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      3 6

      9 1 7

      6 10

      6 1 3 6 3 2

      ```

      #### Output #1
