      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2034H)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Rayan makes his final efforts to win Reyhaneh's heart by claiming he is stronger than Rayaneh (i.e., computer in Persian). To test this, Reyhaneh asks [Khwarizmi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khwarizmi) for help. Khwarizmi explains that a set is integer linearly independent if no element in the set can be written as an integer linear combination of the others. Rayan is given a set of integers each time and must identify one of the largest possible integer linearly independent subsets.

      Note that a single element is always considered an integer linearly independent subset.

      An integer linearly combination of $a_1, \ldots, a_k$ is any sum of the form $c_1 \cdot a_1 + c_2 \cdot a_2 + \ldots + c_k \cdot a_k$ where $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k$ are integers (which may be zero, positive, or negative).

      ### Input

      The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$), the number of test cases.

      The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^5$), the size of the set. The second line contains $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^5$).

      The sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3 \cdot 10^6$.

      ### Output

      In the first line of each test case print the size of the largest integer linearly independent subset.

      In the next line, print one such subset in any order. If there are multiple valid subsets, print any one of them.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      3

      5

      2 4 6 8 10

      5

      12 15 21 30 35

      3

      2 3 6

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      2
      4 6
      3
      35 21 30
      2
      2 3
      ```

      ### Note

      In example 1, $\{4, 6\}$ is an integer linearly independent subset. It can be proven that there is no integer linearly independent subset with at least $3$ elements.

      In example 2, $\{35, 21, 30\}$ is an integer linearly independent subset because no integer linear combination of any two elements can create the third. There is no integer linearly independent subset with at least $4$ elements.

      In example 3, $\{2, 3, 6\}$ is not an integer linearly independent subset since $6$ can be written as $6 \cdot 2 + (-2) \cdot 3$, which is an integer linear combination of $\{2, 3\}$.
