      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2094B)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      In Bobritto Bandito's home town of residence, there are an infinite number of houses on an infinite number line, with houses at $\ldots, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, \ldots$. On day $0$, he started a plague by giving an infection to the unfortunate residents of house $0$. Each succeeding day, the plague spreads to exactly one healthy household that is next to an infected household. It can be shown that each day the infected houses form a continuous segment.

      Let the segment starting at the $l$-th house and ending at the $r$-th house be denoted as $[l, r]$. You know that after $n$ days, the segment $[l, r]$ became infected. Find any such segment $[l', r']$ that could have been infected on the $m$-th day ($m \le n$).

      ### Input

      The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$)Â -- the number of independent test cases.

      The only line of each test case contains four integers $n$, $m$, $l$, and $r$ ($1 \leq m\leq n \leq 2000, -n \leq l \leq 0 \leq r \leq n, r-l=n$).

      ### Output

      For each test case, output two integers $l'$ and $r'$ on a new line. If there are multiple solutions, output any.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      4

      4 2 -2 2

      4 1 0 4

      3 3 -1 2

      9 8 -6 3

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      -1 1
      0 1
      -1 2
      -5 3
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, it is possible that on the $1$-st, $2$-nd, and $3$-rd days the interval of houses affected is $[-1,0]$, $[-1,1]$, $[-2,1]$. Therefore, $[-1,1]$ is a valid output.
