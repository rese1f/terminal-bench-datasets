      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2003A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Turtle thinks a string $s$ is a good string if there exists a sequence of strings $t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_k$ ($k$ is an arbitrary integer) such that:

      - $k \ge 2$.
      - $s = t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k$, where $+$ represents the concatenation operation. For example, $\texttt{abc} = \texttt{a} + \texttt{bc}$.
      - For all $1 \le i < j \le k$, the first character of $t_i$ isn't equal to the last character of $t_j$.

      Turtle is given a string $s$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Please tell him whether the string $s$ is a good string!

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 500$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) -- the length of the string.

      The second line of each test case contains a string $s$ of length $n$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output "YES" if the string $s$ is a good string, and "NO" otherwise.

      You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      4

      2

      aa

      3

      aba

      4

      abcb

      12

      abcabcabcabc

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      No
      nO
      Yes
      YES
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, the sequence of strings $\texttt{a}, \texttt{a}$ satisfies the condition $s = t_1 + t_2 + \ldots + t_k$, but the first character of $t_1$ is equal to the last character of $t_2$. It can be seen that there doesn't exist any sequence of strings which satisfies all of the conditions, so the answer is "NO".

      In the third test case, the sequence of strings $\texttt{ab}, \texttt{cb}$ satisfies all of the conditions.

      In the fourth test case, the sequence of strings $\texttt{abca}, \texttt{bcab}, \texttt{cabc}$ satisfies all of the conditions.
