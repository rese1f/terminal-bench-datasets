      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2092C)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      For her birthday, each of Asuna's $n$ admirers gifted her a tower. The height of the tower from the $i$-th admirer is equal to $a_i$.

      Asuna evaluates the beauty of the received gifts as $\max(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$. She can perform the following operation an arbitrary number of times (possibly, zero).

      - Take such $1 \le i \neq j \le n$ that $a_i + a_j$ is odd and $a_i > 0$, then decrease $a_i$ by $1$ and increase $a_j$ by $1$.

      It is easy to see that the heights of the towers remain non-negative during the operations.

      Help Asuna find the maximum possible beauty of the gifts after any number of operations!

      ### Input

      Each test consists of several test cases. The first line of the input data contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

      The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) -- the number of admirers of Asuna.

      The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n \ (1 \le a_i \le 10^9)$ -- the heights of the towers.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output a single integer: the maximum value of the beauty of the gifts that Asuna can achieve.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      4

      3

      5 3 9

      2

      3 2

      4

      1 2 2 1

      5

      5 4 3 2 9

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      9
      5
      5
      21
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, no pair of towers satisfies the required condition for applying the operation, so no operations can be performed. In this case, the answer is $\max(5, \ 3, \ 9) = 9$.

      In the second test case, the operation with $i = 2$ and $j = 1$ can be applied twice. After that, the array becomes: $a \ = \ [5, \ 0]$. Thus, the answer is 5.

      In the third test case, the following sequence of operations can be applied:

      1. Operation with $i=1$ and $j=2$.
      $[1, \ 2, \ 2, \ 1] \quad \rightarrow \quad [0, \ 3, \ 2, \ 1]$

      2. Operation with $i=3$ and $j=2$.
      $[0, \ 3, \ 2, \ 1] \quad \rightarrow \quad [0, \ 4, \ 1, \ 1]$

      3. Operation with $i=3$ and $j=2$.
      $[0, \ 4, \ 1, \ 1] \quad \rightarrow \quad [0, \ 5, \ 0, \ 1]$


      $\max(0, \ 5, \ 0, \ 1) \ = \ 5$.

      Therefore, the answer is 5.
