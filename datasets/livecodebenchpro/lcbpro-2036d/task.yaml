      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2036D)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      One morning, Polycarp woke up and realized that $1543$ is the most favorite number in his life.

      The first thing that Polycarp saw that day as soon as he opened his eyes was a large wall carpet of size $n$ by $m$ cells; $n$ and $m$ are even integers. Each cell contains one of the digits from $0$ to $9$.

      Polycarp became curious about how many times the number $1543$ would appear in all layers$^{\text{∗}}$ of the carpet when traversed clockwise.

      $^{\text{∗}}$The first layer of a carpet of size $n \times m$ is defined as a closed strip of length $2 \cdot (n+m-2)$ and thickness of $1$ element, surrounding its outer part. Each subsequent layer is defined as the first layer of the carpet obtained by removing all previous layers from the original carpet.

      ### Input

      The first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$) -- the number of test cases. The following lines describe the test cases.

      The first line of each test case contains a pair of numbers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \leq n, m \leq 10^3$, $n, m$ -- even integers).

      This is followed by $n$ lines of length $m$, consisting of digits from $0$ to $9$ -- the description of the carpet.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n \cdot m$ across all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output a single number -- the total number of times $1543$ appears in all layers of the carpet in the order of traversal clockwise.
