      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 1992A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Kmes has written three integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ in order to remember that he has to give Noobish\_Monk $a \times b \times c$ bananas.

      Noobish\_Monk has found these integers and decided to do the following at most $5$ times:

      - pick one of these integers;
      - increase it by $1$.

      For example, if $a = 2$, $b = 3$ and $c = 4$, then one can increase $a$ three times by one and increase $b$ two times. After that $a = 5$, $b = 5$, $c = 4$. Then the total number of bananas will be $5 \times 5 \times 4 = 100$.

      What is the maximum value of $a \times b \times c$ Noobish\_Monk can achieve with these operations?

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) -- the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

      The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $a$, $b$ and $c$ ($1 \le a, b, c \le 10$) -- Kmes's integers.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output a single integer -- the maximum amount of bananas Noobish\_Monk can get.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      2

      2 3 4

      10 1 10

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      100
      600
      ```
