      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2094D)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      You have two drums in front of you: a left drum and a right drum. A hit on the left can be recorded as "L", and a hit on the right as "R".

      The strange forces that rule this world are fickle: sometimes, a blow sounds once, and sometimes it sounds twice. Therefore, a hit on the left drum could have sounded as either "L" or "LL", and a hit on the right drum could have sounded as either "R" or "RR".

      The sequence of hits made is recorded in the string $p$, and the sounds heard are in the string $s$. Given $p$ and $s$, determine whether it is true that the string $s$ could have been the result of the hits from the string $p$.

      For example, if $p=$"LR", then the result of the hits could be any of the strings "LR", "LRR", "LLR", and "LLRR", but the strings "LLLR" or "LRL" cannot.

      ### Input

      The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$)Â -- the number of independent test cases.

      The first line of each test case contains the string $p$ ($1 \le |p| \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) consisting only of the characters "R" and "L", where $|p|$ denotes the length of the string $p$.

      The second line of each test case contains the string $s$ ($1 \le |p| \le |s| \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) consisting only of the characters "R" and "L".

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $|s|$ does not exceed $2\cdot 10^5$ across all test cases.

      ### Output

      For each set of input data, output "YES" if $s$ can be the heard sound, and "NO" otherwise. You may output in any case.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      LLLLLRL

      LLLLRRLL

      LLRLRLRRL

      LLLRLRRLLRRRL

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      YES
      YES
      NO
      NO
      YES
      ```
