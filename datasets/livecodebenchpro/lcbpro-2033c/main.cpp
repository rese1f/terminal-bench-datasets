        // However, since we can only swap elements at positions i and n-i+1, we need to find the best arrangement under this constraint.
        
        // We can try to swap elements at positions i and n-i+1 if a[i] == a[i+1] or a[i] == a[i-1].
        // But a better approach is to count the number of adjacent pairs and see if swapping can reduce it.
        
        // Since the problem allows any number of swaps, we can consider the array as a whole and try to minimize the disturbance.
        // One way is to count the frequency of each element and try to arrange them such that no two same elements are adjacent.
        
        // However, given the swap constraint, it's not straightforward. A practical approach is to try all possible swaps and choose the one that minimizes the disturbance.
        // But with n up to 1e5, this is not feasible.
        
        // Instead, we can consider that swapping elements at positions i and n-i+1 can help in breaking sequences of the same element.
        // For example, if we have a sequence like [1, 1, 1, 2, 3], swapping the second element with the fourth can break the sequence of 1s.
