      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 1998B)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      It is known that [Farmer John likes Permutations](https://usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=1421), but I like them too!

      -- Sun Tzu, The Art of Constructing Permutations

      You are given a permutation$^{\text{∗}}$ $p$ of length $n$.

      Find a permutation $q$ of length $n$ that minimizes the number of pairs ($i, j$) ($1 \leq i \leq j \leq n$) such that $p_i + p_{i+1} + \ldots + p_j = q_i + q_{i+1} + \ldots + q_j$.

      $^{\text{∗}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).

      ### Input

      The first line contains $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.

      The first line of each test case contains $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$).

      The following line contains $n$ space-separated integers $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ ($1 \leq p_i \leq n$) -- denoting the permutation $p$ of length $n$.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output one line containing any permutation of length $n$ (the permutation $q$) such that $q$ minimizes the number of pairs.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      3

      2

      1 2

      5

      1 2 3 4 5

      7

      4 7 5 1 2 6 3

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      2 1
      3 5 4 2 1
      6 2 1 4 7 3 5```

      ### Note

      For the first test, there exists only one pair ($i, j$) ($1 \leq i \leq j \leq n$) such that $p_i + p_{i+1} + \ldots + p_j = q_i + q_{i+1} + \ldots + q_j$, which is ($1, 2$). It can be proven that no such $q$ exists for which there are no pairs.
