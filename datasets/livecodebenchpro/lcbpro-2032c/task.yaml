      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2032C)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      You are given an array $a$ of $n$ elements $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

      You can perform the following operation any number (possibly $0$) of times:

      - Choose two integers $i$ and $j$, where $1 \le i, j \le n$, and assign $a_i := a_j$.

      Find the minimum number of operations required to make the array $a$ satisfy the condition:

      - For every pairwise distinct triplet of indices $(x, y, z)$ ($1 \le x, y, z \le n$, $x \ne y$, $y \ne z$, $x \ne z$), there exists a non-degenerate triangle with side lengths $a_x$, $a_y$ and $a_z$, i.e. $a_x + a_y > a_z$, $a_y + a_z > a_x$ and $a_z + a_x > a_y$.

      ### Input

      Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

      The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) -- the number of elements in the array $a$.

      The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$) -- the elements of the array $a$.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output a single integer -- the minimum number of operations required.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      4

      7

      1 2 3 4 5 6 7

      3

      1 3 2

      3

      4 5 3

      15

      9 3 8 1 6 5 3 8 2 1 4 2 9 4 7

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      3
      1
      0
      8
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, one of the possible series of operations would be:

      - Assign $a_1 := a_4 = 4$. The array will become $[4, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]$.
      - Assign $a_2 := a_5 = 5$. The array will become $[4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]$.
      - Assign $a_7 := a_1 = 4$. The array will become $[4, 5, 3, 4, 5, 6, 4]$.

      It can be proven that any triplet of elements with pairwise distinct indices in the final array forms a non-degenerate triangle, and there is no possible answer using less than $3$ operations.

      In the second test case, we can assign $a_1 := a_2 = 3$ to make the array $a = [3, 3, 2]$.

      In the third test case, since $3$, $4$ and $5$ are valid side lengths of a triangle, we don't need to perform any operation to the array.
