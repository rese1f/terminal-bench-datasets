      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2094A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Trippi Troppi resides in a strange world. The ancient name of each country consists of three strings. The first letter of each string is concatenated to form the country's modern name.

      Given the country's ancient name, please output the modern name.

      ### Input

      The first line contains an integer $t$Â -- the number of independent test cases ($1 \leq t \leq 100$).

      The following $t$ lines each contain three space-separated strings. Each string has a length of no more than $10$, and contains only lowercase Latin characters.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output the string formed by concatenating the first letter of each word.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```
