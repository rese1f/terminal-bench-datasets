      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2114B)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Vlad found a binary string$^{\text{∗}}$ $s$ of even length $n$. He considers a pair of indices ($i, n - i + 1$), where $1 \le i < n - i + 1$, to be good if $s_i = s_{n - i + 1}$ holds true.

      For example, in the string '010001' there is only $1$ good pair, since $s_1 \ne s_6$, $s_2 \ne s_5$, and $s_3=s_4$. In the string '0101' there are no good pairs.

      Vlad loves palindromes, but not too much, so he wants to rearrange some characters of the string so that there are exactly $k$ good pairs of indices.

      Determine whether it is possible to rearrange the characters in the given string so that there are exactly $k$ good pairs of indices ($i, n - i + 1$).

      $^{\text{∗}}$A string $s$ is called binary if it consists only of the characters '0' and '1'

      ### Input

      The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.

      The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $0 \le k \le \frac{n}{2}$, $n$ is even) -- the length of the string and the required number of good pairs.

      The second line of each test case contains a binary string $s$ of length $n$.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output "YES" if there is a way to rearrange the characters of the string so that there are exactly $k$ good pairs, otherwise output "NO".

      You may output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive answer.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      10 1

      1101011001

      2 1

      11

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      NO
      NO
      YES
      NO
      YES
      YES
