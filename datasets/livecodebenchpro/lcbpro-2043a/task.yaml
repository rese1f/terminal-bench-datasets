      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2043A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Initially, you have a coin with value $n$. You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):

      - transform one coin with value $x$, where $x$ is greater than $3$ ($x>3$), into two coins with value $\lfloor \frac{x}{4} \rfloor$.

      What is the maximum number of coins you can have after performing this operation any number of times?

      ### Input

      The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.

      Each test case consists of one line containing one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{18}$).

      ### Output

      For each test case, print one integer -- the maximum number of coins you can have after performing the operation any number of times.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      4

      1

      5

      16

      1000000000000000000

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      1
      2
      4
      536870912
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first example, you have a coin of value $1$, and you can't do anything with it. So, the answer is $1$.

      In the second example, you can transform a coin of value $5$ into two coins with value $1$.

      In the third example, you can transform a coin of value $16$ into two coins with value $4$. Each of the resulting coins can be transformed into two coins with value $1$.
