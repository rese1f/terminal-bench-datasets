      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2008G)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Sakurako has prepared a task for you:

      She gives you an array of $n$ integers and allows you to choose $i$ and $j$ such that $i \neq j$ and $a_i \ge a_j$, and then assign $a_i = a_i - a_j$ or $a_i = a_i + a_j$. You can perform this operation any number of times for any $i$ and $j$, as long as they satisfy the conditions.

      Sakurako asks you what is the maximum possible value of $mex\_k$$^{\\text{∗}}$ of the array after any number of operations.

      $^{\\text{∗}}$$mex\_k$ is the $k$-th non-negative integer that is absent in the array. For example, $mex\_1(\\{1,2,3 \\})=0$, since $0$ is the first element that is not in the array, and $mex\_2(\\{0,2,4 \\})=3$, since $3$ is the second element that is not in the array.

      ### Input

      The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\le t\le 10^4$)  -- the number of test cases.

      The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5,1\le k\le 10^9$)  -- the number of elements in the array and the value $k$ for $mex_k$.

      The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots,a_n$ ($1\le a_i\le 10^9$)  -- the elements of the array.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2\cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output the maximum $mex_k$ that can be achieved through the operations.

      ### Example
