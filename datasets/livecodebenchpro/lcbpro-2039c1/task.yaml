      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2039C1)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      This is the easy version of the problem. The differences between the two versions are highlighted in bold. You can only make hacks if both versions of the problem are solved.

      Shohag has two integers $x$ and $m$. Help him count the number of integers $1 \le y \le m$ such that $\mathbf{x \neq y}$ and $x \oplus y$ is a divisor$^{\text{∗}}$ of either $x$, $y$, or both. Here $\oplus$ is the [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operator.

      $^{\text{∗}}$The number $b$ is a divisor of the number $a$ if there exists an integer $c$ such that $a = b \cdot c$.

      ### Input

      The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.

      The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $x$ and $m$ ($1 \le x \le 10^6$, $1 \le m \le 10^{18}$).

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $x$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^7$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, print a single integer -- the number of suitable $y$.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      5

      6 9

      5 7

      2 3

      6 4

      4 1

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      3
      2
      1
      1
      0
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, for $x = 6$, there are $3$ valid values for $y$ among the integers from $1$ to $m = 9$, and they are $4$, $5$, and $7$.

      - $y = 4$ is valid because $x \oplus y = 6 \oplus 4 = 2$ and $2$ is a divisor of both $x = 6$ and $y = 4$.
      - $y = 5$ is valid because $x \oplus y = 6 \oplus 5 = 3$ and $3$ is a divisor of $x = 6$.
      - $y = 7$ is valid because $x \oplus y = 6 \oplus 7 = 1$ and $1$ is a divisor of both $x = 6$ and $y = 7$.

      In the second test case, for $x = 5$, there are $2$ valid values for $y$ among the integers from $1$ to $m = 7$, and they are $4$ and $6$.

      - $y = 4$ is valid because $x \oplus y = 5 \oplus 4 = 1$ and $1$ is a divisor of both $x = 5$ and $y = 4$.
      - $y = 6$ is valid because $x \oplus y = 5 \oplus 6 = 3$ and $3$ is a divisor of $y = 6$.
