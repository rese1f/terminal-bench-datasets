      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2075D)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      You are given two non-negative integers $x$ and $y$.

      You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero): choose a positive integer $k$ and divide either $x$ or $y$ by $2^k$ rounding down. The cost of this operation is $2^k$. However, there is an additional constraint: you cannot select the same value of $k$ more than once.

      Your task is to calculate the minimum possible cost in order to make $x$ equal to $y$.

      ### Input

      The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^5$) -- the number of test cases.

      The only line of each test case contains two integers $x$ and $y$ ($0 \le x, y \le 10^{17}$).

      ### Output

      For each test case, print a single integer -- the minimum possible cost in order to make $x$ equal to $y$.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      5

      0 1

      6 2

      3 3

      13 37

      4238659325782394 12983091057341925

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      2
      6
      0
      26
      32764
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first example, you can proceed as follows: choose $k=1$ and divide $y$ by $2$. After that, $x$ and $y$ are equal to $0$.

      In the second example, you can proceed as follows: choose $k=2$ and divide $x$ by $4$; choose $k=1$ and divide $y$ by $2$. After that, $x$ and $y$ are equal to $1$.

      In the third example, numbers already are equal.
