      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 1996B)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Tina has a square grid with $n$ rows and $n$ columns. Each cell in the grid is either $0$ or $1$.

      Tina wants to reduce the grid by a factor of $k$ ($k$ is a divisor of $n$). To do this, Tina splits the grid into $k \times k$ nonoverlapping blocks of cells such that every cell belongs to exactly one block.

      Tina then replaces each block of cells with a single cell equal to the value of the cells in the block. It is guaranteed that every cell in the same block has the same value.

      For example, the following demonstration shows a grid being reduced by factor of $3$.

      Help Tina reduce the grid by a factor of $k$.

      ### Input

      The first line contains $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$) -- the number of test cases.

      The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$, $1 \le k \le n$, $k$ is a divisor of $n$) -- the number of rows and columns of the grid, and the factor that Tina wants to reduce the grid by.

      Each of the following $n$ lines contain $n$ characters describing the cells of the grid. Each character is either $0$ or $1$. It is guaranteed every $k$ by $k$ block has the same value.

      It is guaranteed the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $1000$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output the grid reduced by a factor of $k$ on a new line.
