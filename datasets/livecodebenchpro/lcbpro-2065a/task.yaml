      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2065A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Skibidus lands on a foreign planet, where the local Amog tribe speaks the Amog'u language. In Amog'u, there are two forms of nouns, which are singular and plural.

      Given that the root of the noun is transcribed as $S$, the two forms are transcribed as:

      - Singular: $S$ $+$ "us"
      - Plural: $S$ $+$ "i"

      Here, $+$ denotes [string concatenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation). For example, abc $+$ def $=$ abcdef.

      For example, when $S$ is transcribed as "amog", then the singular form is transcribed as "amogus", and the plural form is transcribed as "amogi". Do note that Amog'u nouns can have an empty root -- in specific, "us" is the singular form of "i" (which, on an unrelated note, means "imposter" and "imposters" respectively).

      Given a transcribed Amog'u noun in singular form, please convert it to the transcription of the corresponding plural noun.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The only line of each test case contains a string $W$, which is a transcribed Amog'u noun in singular form. It is guaranteed that $W$ consists of only lowercase English letters, has a length of at most $10$, and ends with "us".

      ### Output

      For each test case, output the transcription of the corresponding plural noun on a separate line.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      9

      us

      sus

      fungus

      cactus

      sussus

      amogus

      chungus

      ntarsus

      skibidus

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      i
      si
      fungi
      cacti
      sussi
      amogi
      chungi
      ntarsi
      skibidi
      ```
