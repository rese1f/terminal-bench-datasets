      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2070A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      FizzBuzz is one of the most well-known problems from coding interviews. In this problem, we will consider a remixed version of FizzBuzz:

      Given an integer $n$, process all integers from $0$ to $n$. For every integer such that its remainders modulo $3$ and modulo $5$ are the same (so, for every integer $i$ such that $i \bmod 3 = i \bmod 5$), printFizzBuzz.

      However, you don't have to solve it. Instead, given the integer $n$, you have to report how many times the correct solution to that problem will print FizzBuzz.

      ### Input

      The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.

      Each test case contains one line consisting of one integer $n$ ($0 \le n \le 10^9$).

      ### Output

      For each test case, print one integer -- the number of times the correct solution will print FizzBuzz with the given value of $n$.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      7

      0

      5

      15

      42

      1337

      17101997

      998244353

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      1
      3
      4
      9
      270
      3420402
      199648872
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, the solution will print FizzBuzz for the integer $0$.

      In the second test case, the solution will print FizzBuzz for the integers $0, 1, 2$.

      In the third test case, the solution will print FizzBuzz for the integers $0, 1, 2, 15$.
