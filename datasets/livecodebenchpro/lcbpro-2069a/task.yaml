      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2069A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      For an array of integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$, we define its equality characteristic as the array $b_2, b_3, \dots, b_{n-1}$, where $b_i = 1$ if the $i$-th element of the array $a$ is equal to both of its neighbors, and $b_i = 0$ if the $i$-th element of the array $a$ is not equal to at least one of its neighbors.

      For example, for the array $[1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]$, the equality characteristic will be $[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1]$.

      You are given the array $b_2, b_3, \dots, b_{n-1}$. Your task is to determine whether there exists such an array $a$ for which the given array is the equality characteristic.

      ### Input

      The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) -- the number of test cases.

      Each test case consists of two lines:

      - the first line contains one integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 100$);
      - the second line contains $n-2$ integers $b_2, b_3, \dots, b_{n-1}$ ($0 \le b_i \le 1$).

      ### Output

      For each test case, output YES if the array $a$ exists, or NO if such an array does not exist. Each letter can be printed in any case.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      3

      10

      0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1

      3

      1

      10

      0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      YES
      YES
      NO
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first example, the array $a = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]$ is suitable.

      In the second example, the array $a = [7, 7, 7]$ is suitable.
