      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2069C)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Let's call an integer sequence beautiful if the following conditions hold:

      - its length is at least $3$;
      - for every element except the first one, there is an element to the left less than it;
      - for every element except the last one, there is an element to the right larger than it;

      For example, $[1, 4, 2, 4, 7]$ and $[1, 2, 4, 8]$ are beautiful, but $[1, 2]$, $[2, 2, 4]$, and $[1, 3, 5, 3]$ are not.

      Recall that a subsequence is a sequence that can be obtained from another sequence by removing some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

      You are given an integer array $a$ of size $n$, where every element is from $1$ to $3$. Your task is to calculate the number of beautiful subsequences of the array $a$. Since the answer might be large, print it modulo $998244353$.

      ### Input

      The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.

      The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).

      The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 3$).

      Additional constraint on the input: the sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, print a single integer -- the number of beautiful subsequences of the array $a$, taken modulo $998244353$.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      4

      7

      3 2 1 2 2 1 3

      4

      3 1 2 2

      3

      1 2 3

      9

      1 2 3 2 1 3 2 2 3

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      3
      0
      1
      22
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case of the example, the following subsequences are beautiful:

      - $[a_3, a_4, a_7]$;
      - $[a_3, a_5, a_7]$;
      - $[a_3, a_4, a_5, a_7]$.
