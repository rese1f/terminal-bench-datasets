      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2065C2)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      This is the hard version of the problem. In this version, $m \leq 2\cdot 10^5$.

      Skibidus has obtained two arrays $a$ and $b$, containing $n$ and $m$ elements respectively. For each integer $i$ from $1$ to $n$, he is allowed to perform the operation at most once:

      - Choose an integer $j$ such that $1 \leq j \leq m$. Set $a_i := b_j - a_i$. Note that $a_i$ may become non-positive as a result of this operation.

      Skibidus needs your help determining whether he can sort $a$ in non-decreasing order$^{\text{∗}}$ by performing the above operation some number of times.

      $^{\\text{∗}}$$a$ is sorted in non-decreasing order if $a\_1 \\leq a\_2 \\leq \\ldots \\leq a\_n$.

      ### Input

      The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.

      The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \leq m \leq 2\cdot 10^5$).

      The following line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$).

      The following line of each test case contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$ ($1 \leq b_i \leq 10^9$).

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ and the sum of $m$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, if it is possible to sort $a$ in non-decreasing order, print "YES" on a new line. Otherwise, print "NO" on a new line.

      You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", and "Yes" will also be recognized as positive responses.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      5

      1 3

      5

      9 1 1000000000

      3 2

      1 4 3

      3 4

      4 3

      2 4 6 5

      6 1 8

      5 2

      6 4 5 4 5

      4 1000

      3 1

      9 8 7

      8

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      YES
      NO
      YES
      NO
      YES
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, $[5]$ is already sorted.

      In the second test case, it can be shown that it is impossible.

      In the third test case, we can set $a_2:=b_1-a_2=6-4=2$ and $a_3:=b_3-a_3=8-6=2$. The sequence $[2,2,2,5]$ is in nondecreasing order.

      In the last case, we can apply operations on each index. The sequence becomes $[-1,0,1]$, which is in nondecreasing order.
