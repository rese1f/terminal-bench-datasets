    Solution approach: Dynamic Programming on bits.

    Problem: Find a non-negative integer x such that sum(a_i XOR x) = s.
    The numbers a_i and s are given in binary representation of length k.
    We need to find the binary representation of x, also length k.

    We process the bits of x from Least Significant Bit (LSB, index 0) to Most Significant Bit (MSB, index k-1).
    The state of the DP is (j, C), representing that we have processed bits 0 to j-1 of x, and the carry propagated into bit position j from position j-1 during the sum calculation is C.
    Our goal is to determine if we can reach state (k, 0), which means after processing all k bits, the final carry is 0 (ensuring the sum is exactly s and does not exceed 2^k - 1).

    Details of the transition:
    At step j (processing bit j):
    We need to decide the j-th bit of x, denoted x_j (0 or 1).
    Let N1 be the count of numbers a_i such that the j-th bit of a_i is 1.
    Let N0 be the count of numbers a_i such that the j-th bit of a_i is 0. Note N0 = n - N1.
    Let s_j be the j-th bit of the target sum s.
    Let C be the carry into bit position j from bit position j-1.

    If we choose x_j = 0:
    The j-th bit of (a_i XOR x) is the same as the j-th bit of a_i.
    The sum of the j-th bits across all i is N1.
    The total value contributed by bit position j (including carry-in) is T0 = N1 + C.
    The j-th bit of the final sum S is T0 mod 2. This must match s_j.
    The carry propagated to the next position (j+1) is C_{j+1} = floor(T0 / 2).
    This transition is valid if (T0 mod 2 == s_j) and C_{j+1} <= n (since max carry cannot exceed n).

    If we choose x_j = 1:
    The j-th bit of (a_i XOR x) is the flipped j-th bit of a_i.
    The sum of the j-th bits across all i is N0.
    The total value contributed by bit position j (including carry-in) is T1 = N0 + C.
    The j-th bit of the final sum S is T1 mod 2. This must match s_j.
    The carry propagated to the next position (j+1) is C_{j+1} = floor(T1 / 2).
    This transition is valid if (T1 mod 2 == s_j) and C_{j+1} <= n.

    We use DP tables to store reachability and path information:
    dp[step][carry]: Stores the bit choice (0 or 1) for x_{step-1} that led to reaching state (step, carry). Initialized to -1 (unreachable).
    parent_carry[step][carry]: Stores the carry value C_{step-1} from the previous state (step-1, C_{step-1}) which led to state (step, carry).

    Base case: dp[0][0] = 0. This signifies that at step 0 (before processing any bits), the carry is 0. The choice value is arbitrary but needed to mark state reachable.

    The DP iterates from j = 0 to k-1. After the loop, we check if dp[k][0] != -1. If yes, a solution exists.
    We reconstruct the binary string for x by backtracking from state (k, 0) using the parent_carry table to find the sequence of carries, and the dp table to find the corresponding choices for x_j bits.

    Complexity:
    Time: O(N*K) for precomputing N1 counts + O(N*K) for DP computation + O(K) for reconstruction. Overall O(N*K).
    Memory: O(N*K) for the DP tables dp and parent_carry.
    The problem constraint N*K <= 2*10^6 makes this approach feasible.
