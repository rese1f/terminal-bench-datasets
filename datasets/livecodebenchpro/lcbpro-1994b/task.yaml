      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 1994B)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Vova really loves the [XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR) operation (denoted as $\oplus$). Recently, when he was going to sleep, he came up with a fun game.

      At the beginning of the game, Vova chooses two binary sequences $s$ and $t$ of length $n$ and gives them to Vanya. A binary sequence is a sequence consisting only of the numbers $0$ and $1$. Vanya can choose integers $l, r$ such that $1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$, and for all $l \leq i \leq r$ simultaneously replace $s_i$ with $s_i \oplus s_{i - l + 1}$, where $s_i$ is the $i$-th element of the sequence $s$.

      In order for the game to be interesting, there must be a possibility to win. Vanya wins if, with an unlimited number of actions, he can obtain the sequence $t$ from the sequence $s$. Determine if the game will be interesting for the sequences $s$ and $t$.

      ### Input

      Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 10^{4}$) -- the number of test cases. Then follows the description of the test cases.

      The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) -- the length of the sequences $s$ and $t$.

      The second line of each test case contains a binary sequence $s$ of length $n$.

      The third line of each test case contains a binary sequence $t$ of length $n$.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output "Yes" if the game will be interesting, otherwise output "No".

      You can output each letter in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      6

      1

      0

      1

      7

      0110100

      0110100

      9

      100101010

      101111110

      4

      0011

      1011

      4

      0100

      0001

      8

      10110111

      01100000

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      NO
      YES
      YES
      NO
      YES
      YES
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, Vanya will not be able to change the sequence $s$ with the only possible action of choosing $l = r = 1$.

      In the second test case, the sequences $s$ and $t$ are already equal.

      In the third test case, Vanya can act as follows:

      1. Choose $l = 3$ and $r = 5$, then $s$ will become $\mathtt{101101010}$.
      2. Choose $l = 5$ and $r = 6$, then $s$ will become $\mathtt{101111010}$.
      3. Choose $l = 7$ and $r = 7$, then $s$ will become $\mathtt{101111110}$.
