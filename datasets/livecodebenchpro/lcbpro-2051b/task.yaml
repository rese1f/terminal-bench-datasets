      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2051B)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Monocarp decided to embark on a long hiking journey.

      He decided that on the first day he would walk $a$ kilometers, on the second day he would walk $b$ kilometers, on the third day he would walk $c$ kilometers, on the fourth day, just like on the first, he would walk $a$ kilometers, on the fifth day, just like on the second, he would walk $b$ kilometers, on the sixth day, just like on the third, he would walk $c$ kilometers, and so on.

      Monocarp will complete his journey on the day when he has walked at least $n$ kilometers in total. Your task is to determine the day on which Monocarp will complete his journey.

      ### Input

      The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.

      Each test case consists of one line containing four integers $n$, $a$, $b$, $c$ ($1 \le n \le 10^9$; $1 \le a, b, c \le 10^6$).

      ### Output

      For each test case, output one integer -- the day on which Monocarp will have walked at least $n$ kilometers in total and will complete his journey.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      4

      12 1 5 3

      6 6 7 4

      16 3 4 1

      1000000000 1 1 1

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      5
      1
      6
      1000000000
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first example, over the first four days, Monocarp will cover $1 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 10$ kilometers. On the fifth day, he will cover another $5$ kilometers, meaning that in total over five days he will have covered $10 + 5 = 15$ kilometers. Since $n = 12$, Monocarp will complete his journey on the fifth day.

      In the second example, Monocarp will cover $6$ kilometers on the first day. Since $n = 6$, Monocarp will complete his journey on the very first day.

      In the third example, Monocarp will cover $3 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 = 16$ kilometers over the first six days. Since $n = 16$, Monocarp will complete his journey on the sixth day.
