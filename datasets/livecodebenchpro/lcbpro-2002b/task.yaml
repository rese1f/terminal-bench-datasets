      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2002B)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Alice got a permutation $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ of $[1,2,\ldots,n]$, and Bob got another permutation $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ of $[1,2,\ldots,n]$. They are going to play a game with these arrays.

      In each turn, the following events happen in order:

      - Alice chooses either the first or the last element of her array and removes it from the array;
      - Bob chooses either the first or the last element of his array and removes it from the array.

      The game continues for $n-1$ turns, after which both arrays will have exactly one remaining element: $x$ in the array $a$ and $y$ in the array $b$.

      If $x=y$, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins. Find which player will win if both players play optimally.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1\le t\le10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1\le n\le 3\cdot 10^5$).

      The next line contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ ($1\le a_i\le n$, all $a_i$ are distinct) -- the permutation of Alice.

      The next line contains $n$ integers $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n$ ($1\le b_i\le n$, all $b_i$ are distinct) -- the permutation of Bob.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of all $n$ does not exceed $3\cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, print a single line with the name of the winner, assuming both players play optimally. If Alice wins, print $\texttt{Alice}$; otherwise, print $\texttt{Bob}$.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      2

      2

      1 2

      1 2

      3

      1 2 3

      2 3 1

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      Bob
      Alice
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, Bob can win the game by deleting the same element as Alice did.

      In the second test case, Alice can delete $3$ in the first turn, and then in the second turn, delete the element that is different from the one Bob deleted in the first turn to win the game.
