      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2121E)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      For two integers $a$ and $b$, we define $f(a, b)$ as the number of positions in the decimal representation of the numbers $a$ and $b$ where their digits are the same. For example, $f(12, 21) = 0$, $f(31, 37) = 1$, $f(19891, 18981) = 2$, $f(54321, 24361) = 3$.

      You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ of the same length in decimal representation. Consider all integers $l \leq x \leq r$. Your task is to find the minimum value of $f(l, x) + f(x, r)$.

      ### Input

      Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

      Each test case consists of a single line containing two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \leq l \leq r < 10^9$).

      It is guaranteed that the numbers $l$ and $r$ have the same length in decimal representation and do not have leading zeros.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output the minimum value of $f(l, x) + f(x, r)$ among all integer values $l \leq x \leq r$.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      14

      1 1

      2 3

      4 6

      15 16

      17 19

      199 201

      899 999

      1990 2001

      6309 6409

      12345 12501

      19987 20093

      746814 747932

      900990999 900991010

      999999999 999999999

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      2
      1
      0
      3
      2
      2
      1
      3
      3
      4
      3
      5
      12
      18
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, you can choose $x = 1$. Then $f(1, 1) + f(1, 1) = 1 + 1 = 2$.

      In the second test case, you can choose $x = 2$. Then $f(2, 2) + f(2, 3) = 1 + 0 = 1$.

      In the third test case, you can choose $x = 5$. Then $f(4, 5) + f(5, 6) = 0 + 0 = 0$.

      In the fourth test case, you can choose $x = 15$. Then $f(15, 15) + f(15, 16) = 2 + 1 = 3$.

      In the fifth test case, you can choose $x = 18$. Then $f(17, 18) + f(18, 19) = 1 + 1 = 2$.

      In the sixth test case, you can choose $x = 200$. Then $f(199, 200) + f(200, 201) = 0 + 2 = 2$.

      In the seventh test case, you can choose $x = 900$. Then $f(899, 900) + f(900, 999) = 0 + 1 = 1$.

      In the eighth test case, you can choose $x = 1992$. Then $f(1990, 1992) + f(1992, 2001) = 3 + 0 = 3$.
