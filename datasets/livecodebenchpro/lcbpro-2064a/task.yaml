      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2064A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      One day after waking up, your friend challenged you to a brogramming contest. In a brogramming contest, you are given a binary string$^{\text{∗}}$ $s$ of length $n$ and an initially empty binary string $t$. During a brogramming contest, you can make either of the following moves any number of times:

      - remove some suffix$^{\text{†}}$ from $s$ and place it at the end of $t$, or
      - remove some suffix from $t$ and place it at the end of $s$.

      To win the brogramming contest, you must make the minimum number of moves required to make $s$ contain only the character $\texttt{0}$ and $t$ contain only the character $\texttt{1}$. Find the minimum number of moves required.

      $^{\text{∗}}$A binary string is a string consisting of characters $\texttt{0}$ and $\texttt{1}$.

      $^{\text{†}}$A string $a$ is a suffix of a string $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning of $b$.

      ### Input

      The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) -- the number of test cases.

      The first line of each test case is an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) -- the length of the string $s$.

      The second line of each test case contains the binary string $s$.

      The sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $1000$.

      ### Output

      For each testcase, output the minimum number of moves required.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      5

      5

      00110

      4

      1111

      3

      001

      5

      00000

      3

      101

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      2
      1
      1
      0
      3
      ```

      ### Note

      An optimal solution to the first test case is as follows:

      - $s = \texttt{00}\color{red}{\texttt{110}}$, $t =$ empty string.
      - $s = \texttt{00}$, $t = \texttt{11}\color{red}{\texttt{0}}$.
      - $s = \texttt{000}$, $t = \texttt{11}$.

      It can be proven that there is no solution using less than $2$ moves.

      In the second test case, you have to move the whole string from $s$ to $t$ in one move.

      In the fourth test case, you don't have to do any moves.
