      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2044B)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      A string consisting of only characters 'p', 'q', and 'w' is painted on a glass window of a store. Ship walks past the store, standing directly in front of the glass window, and observes string $a$. Ship then heads inside the store, looks directly at the same glass window, and observes string $b$.

      Ship gives you string $a$. Your job is to find and output $b$.

      ### Input

      The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$) -- the number of test cases.

      The only line of each test case contains a string $a$ ($1 \leq |a| \leq 100$) -- the string Ship observes from outside the store. It is guaranteed that $a$ only contains characters 'p', 'q', and 'w'.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output string $b$, the string Ship observes from inside the store, on a new line.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      5

      qwq

      ppppp

      pppwwwqqq

      wqpqwpqwwqp

      pqpqpqpq

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      pwp
      qqqqq
      pppwwwqqq
      qpwwpqwpqpw
      pqpqpqpq
      ```
