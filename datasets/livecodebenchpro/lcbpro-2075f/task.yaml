      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2075F)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Let's call an integer sequence beautiful if the following conditions hold:

      - for every element except the first one, there is an element to the left less than it;
      - for every element except the last one, there is an element to the right larger than it;

      For example, $[1, 2]$, $[42]$, $[1, 4, 2, 4, 7]$, and $[1, 2, 4, 8]$ are beautiful, but $[2, 2, 4]$ and $[1, 3, 5, 3]$ are not.

      Recall that a subsequence is a sequence that can be obtained from another sequence by removing some elements (possibly zero) without changing the order of the remaining elements.

      You are given an integer array $a$ of size $n$. Find the longest beautiful subsequence of the array $a$ and print its length.

      ### Input

      The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases. Next, $t$ independent cases follow.

      The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^5$) -- the length of array $a$.

      The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^6$) -- the array $a$.

      Additional constraint on the input: the total sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, print one integer -- the length of the longest beautiful subsequence of array $a$.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      5

      1

      42

      5

      1 2 3 4 5

      6

      6 5 4 3 2 1

      7

      1 1 3 4 2 3 4

      6

      2 3 1 1 2 4

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      1
      5
