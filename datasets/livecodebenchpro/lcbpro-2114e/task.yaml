      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2114E)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Once, Kirei stealthily infiltrated the trap-filled estate of the Ainzbern family but was discovered by Kiritugu's familiar. Assessing his strength, Kirei decided to retreat. The estate is represented as a tree with $n$ vertices, with the root at vertex $1$. Each vertex of the tree has a number $a_i$ recorded, which represents the danger of vertex $i$. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.

      For a successful retreat, Kirei must compute the threat value for each vertex. The threat of a vertex is equal to the maximumalternating sum along the vertical path starting from that vertex. The alternating sum along the vertical path starting from vertex $i$ is defined as $a_i - a_{p_i} + a_{p_{p_i}} - \ldots$, where $p_i$ is the parent of vertex $i$ on the path to the root (to vertex $1$).

      For example, in the tree below, vertex $4$ has the following vertical paths:

      - $[4]$ with an alternating sum of $a_4 = 6$;
      - $[4, 3]$ with an alternating sum of $a_4 - a_3 = 6 - 2 = 4$;
      - $[4, 3, 2]$ with an alternating sum of $a_4 - a_3 + a_2 = 6 - 2 + 5 = 9$;
      - $[4, 3, 2, 1]$ with an alternating sum of $a_4 - a_3 + a_2 - a_1 = 6 - 2 + 5 - 4 = 5$.

      ![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/1d786fdded1f234d101767c2c7b55e98960c8af0.png)The dangers of the vertices are indicated in red.

      Help Kirei compute the threat values for all vertices and escape the estate.

      ### Input

      The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.

      The following describes the test cases.

      The first line contains an integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) -- the number of vertices in the tree.

      The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$) -- the dangers of the vertices.

      The next $n - 1$ lines contain the numbers $v, u$ ($1 \le v, u \le n$, $v \neq u$) -- the description of the edges of the tree.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$. It is also guaranteed that the given set of edges forms a tree.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output $n$ integers -- the threat of each vertex.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      3 4

      5 1

      2 5

      1 6

      6 4

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```

      1000000000 1500500096 1701701691 199199209 404 800800800
      ```

      ### Note

      The tree from the first test case is depicted in the statement, and the maximum variable-sign sums are achieved as follows:

      1. $a_1 = 4$;
      2. $a_2 = 5$;
      3. $a_3 = 2$;
      4. $a_4 - a_3 + a_2 = 6 - 2 + 5 = 9$;
      5. $a_5 = 7$.
