      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2040D)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      You are given a tree with $n$ vertices.

      You need to construct an array $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ of length $n$, consisting of unique integers from $1$ to $2 \cdot n$, and such that for each edge $u_i \leftrightarrow v_i$ of the tree, the value $|a_{u_i} - a_{v_i}|$ is not a prime number.

      Find any array that satisfies these conditions, or report that there is no such array.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$)Â -- the number of vertices in the tree.

      The next $n - 1$ lines contain the edges of the tree, one edge per line. The $i$-th line contains two integers $u_i$ and $v_i$ ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$; $u_i \neq v_i$), denoting the edge between the nodes $u_i$ and $v_i$.

      It's guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10 ^ 5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, if an array that satisfies the conditions exists, print its elements $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. Otherwise, print $-1$.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      2

      5

      1 2

      2 3

      2 4

      3 5

      7

      1 2

      1 3

      2 4

      3 5

      3 6

      3 7

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      2 10 1 6 5
      8 7 12 1 4 6 3
      ```

      ### Note

      The possible answers are shown below. Instead of the vertex numbers, the corresponding elements of the array $a$ are written in them.
