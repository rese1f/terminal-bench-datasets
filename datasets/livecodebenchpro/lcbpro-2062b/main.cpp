        // Just before the reset at time t+T_i, the clock time is a_i - T_i (if reset at t).
        // The problem states that if a clock reaches 0 after the decrease step, you lose.
        // This means after decreasing, the time must be >= 1.
        // So, at the time of reset (just before the decrease step), the time must be >= 2.
