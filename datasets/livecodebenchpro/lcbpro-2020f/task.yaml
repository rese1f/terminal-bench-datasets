      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2020F)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Let $n$ and $d$ be positive integers. We build the the divisor tree $T_{n,d}$ as follows:

      - The root of the tree is a node marked with number $n$. This is the $0$-th layer of the tree.
      - For each $i$ from $0$ to $d - 1$, for each vertex of the $i$-th layer, do the following. If the current vertex is marked with $x$, create its children and mark them with all possible distinct divisors$^\dagger$ of $x$. These children will be in the $(i+1)$-st layer.
      - The vertices on the $d$-th layer are the leaves of the tree.

      For example, $T_{6,2}$ (the divisor tree for $n = 6$ and $d = 2$) looks like this:

      ![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/78c70e79ff2523fff4760665c9512ce7f9360607.png)

      Define $f(n,d)$ as the number of leaves in $T_{n,d}$.

      Given integers $n$, $k$, and $d$, please compute $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} f(i^k,d)$, modulo $10^9+7$.

      $^\dagger$ In this problem, we say that an integer $y$ is a divisor of $x$ if $y \ge 1$ and there exists an integer $z$ such that $x = y \cdot z$.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The only line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $k$, and $d$ ($1 \le n \le 10^9$, $1 \le k,d \le 10^5$).

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^9$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n} f(i^k,d)$, modulo $10^9+7$.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      3

      6 1 1

      1 3 3

      10 1 2

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      14
      1
      53
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, $n = 6$, $k = 1$, and $d = 1$. Thus, we need to find the total number of leaves in the divisor trees $T_{1,1}$, $T_{2,1}$, $T_{3,1}$, $T_{4,1}$, $T_{5,1}$, $T_{6,1}$.

      - $T_{1,1}$ has only one leaf, which is marked with $1$.
      - $T_{2,1}$ has two leaves, marked with $1$ and $2$.
      - $T_{3,1}$ has two leaves, marked with $1$ and $3$.
      - $T_{4,1}$ has three leaves, marked with $1$, $2$, and $4$.
      - $T_{5,1}$ has two leaves, marked with $1$ and $5$.
      - $T_{6,1}$ has four leaves, marked with $1$, $2$, $3$, and $6$.

      The total number of leaves is $1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 14$.

      In the second test case, $n = 1$, $k = 3$, $d = 3$. Thus, we need to find the number of leaves in $T_{1,3}$, because $1^3 = 1$. This tree has only one leaf, so the answer is $1$.
