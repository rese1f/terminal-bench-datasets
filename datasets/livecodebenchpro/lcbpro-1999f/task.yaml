      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 1999F)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Arul has a binary array$^{\text{∗}}$ $a$ of length $n$.

      He will take all subsequences$^{\text{†}}$ of length $k$ ($k$ is odd) of this array and find their median.$^{\text{‡}}$

      What is the sum of all these values?

      As this sum can be very large, output it modulo $10^9 + 7$. In other words, print the remainder of this sum when divided by $10^9 + 7$.

      $^{\text{∗}}$A binary array is an array consisting only of zeros and ones.

      $^{\text{†}}$An array $b$ is a subsequence of an array $a$ if $b$ can be obtained from $a$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. Subsequences don't have to be contiguous.

      $^{\text{‡}}$The median of an array of odd length $k$ is the $\frac{k+1}{2}$-th element when sorted.

      ### Input

      The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.

      The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$, $k$ is odd) -- the length of the array and the length of the subsequence, respectively.

      The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($0 \leq a_i \leq 1$) -- the elements of the array.

      It is guaranteed that sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, print the sum modulo $10^9 + 7$.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      8

      4 3

      1 0 0 1

      5 1

      1 1 1 1 1

      5 5

      0 1 0 1 0

      6 3

      1 0 1 0 1 1

      4 3

      1 0 1 1

      5 3

      1 0 1 1 0

      2 1

      0 0

      34 17

      1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      2
      5
      0
      16
      4
      7
      0
      333606206
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, there are four subsequences of $[1,0,0,1]$ with length $k=3$:

      - $[1,0,0]$: median $= 0$.
      - $[1,0,1]$: median $= 1$.
      - $[1,0,1]$: median $= 1$.
      - $[0,0,1]$: median $= 0$.

      The sum of the results is $0+1+1+0=2$.

      In the second test case, all subsequences of length $1$ have median $1$, so the answer is $5$.
