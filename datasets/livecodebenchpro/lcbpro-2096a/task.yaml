      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2096A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      You are the proud owner of $n$ sticks. Each stick has an integer length from $1$ to $n$. The lengths of the sticks are distinct.

      You want to arrange the sticks in a row. There is a string $s$ of length $n - 1$ that describes the requirements of the arrangement.

      Specifically, for each $i$ from $1$ to $n - 1$:

      - If $s_i = \texttt{<}$, then the length of the stick at position $i + 1$ must be smaller than all sticks before it;
      - If $s_i = \texttt{>}$, then the length of the stick at position $i + 1$ must be larger than all sticks before it.

      Find any valid arrangement of sticks. We can show that an answer always exists.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 500$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) -- the number of sticks.

      The second line of each test case contains a single string $s$ of length $n - 1$ consisting of characters $\texttt{<}$ and $\texttt{>}$ -- describing the requirements of the arrangement.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq n$, the $a_i$ are distinct) -- the lengths of the sticks in order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      5

      2

      <

      5

      <<><

      2

      >

      3

      <>

      7

      ><>>><

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      2 1
      4 3 2 5 1
      1 2
      2 1 3
      3 4 2 5 6 7 1
      ```

      ### Note

      For the first test case, the requirements of the arrangement are as follows:

      - $s_1 = \texttt{<}$, which means $a_2$ is smaller than $a_1$.

      Thus, one possible arrangement is $[2, 1]$.

      For the second test case, the requirements of the arrangement are as follows:

      - $s_1 = \texttt{<}$, which means $a_2$ is smaller than $a_1$;
      - $s_2 = \texttt{<}$, which means $a_3$ is smaller than $a_1$ and $a_2$;
      - $s_3 = \texttt{>}$, which means $a_4$ is larger than $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$;
      - $s_4 = \texttt{<}$, which means $a_5$ is smaller than $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, and $a_4$.

      Thus, one possible arrangement is $[4, 3, 2, 5, 1]$.
