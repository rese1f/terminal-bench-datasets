      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2003F)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Piggy gives Turtle three sequences $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$, $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$, and $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$.

      Turtle will choose a subsequence of $1, 2, \ldots, n$ of length $m$, let it be $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$. The subsequence should satisfy the following conditions:

      - $a_{p_1} \le a_{p_2} \le \cdots \le a_{p_m}$;
      - All $b_{p_i}$ for all indices $i$ are pairwise distinct, i.e., there don't exist two different indices $i$, $j$ such that $b_{p_i} = b_{p_j}$.

      Help him find the maximum value of $\sum\limits_{i = 1}^m c_{p_i}$, or tell him that it is impossible to choose a subsequence of length $m$ that satisfies the conditions above.

      Recall that a sequence $a$ is a subsequence of a sequence $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

      ### Input

      The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 3000$, $1 \le m \le 5$) -- the lengths of the three sequences and the required length of the subsequence.

      The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$) -- the elements of the sequence $a$.

      The third line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ ($1 \le b_i \le n$) -- the elements of the sequence $b$.

      The fourth line contains $n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$ ($1 \le c_i \le 10^4$) -- the elements of the sequence $c$.

      ### Output

      Output a single integer -- the maximum value of $\sum\limits_{i = 1}^m c_{p_i}$. If it is impossible to choose a subsequence of length $m$ that satisfies the conditions above, output $-1$.

      ### Examples

      #### Input #1

      ```

      4 2

      2 3 4 2

      1 3 3 2

      1 4 2 3

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      5
      ```

      #### Input #2

      ```

      7 3

      1 4 5 2 3 6 7

      1 2 2 1 1 3 2

      1 5 6 7 3 2 4

      ```

      #### Output #2

      ```
      13
      ```

      #### Input #3

      ```

      5 3

      1 2 3 4 5

      1 1 2 1 2

      5 4 3 2 1

      ```

      #### Output #3

      ```
      -1
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first example, we can choose $p = [1, 2]$, then $c_{p_1} + c_{p_2} = 1 + 4 = 5$. We can't choose $p = [2, 4]$ since $a_2 > a_4$, violating the first condition. We can't choose $p = [2, 3]$ either since $b_2 = b_3$, violating the second condition. We can choose $p = [1, 4]$, but $c_1 + c_4 = 4$, which isn't maximum.

      In the second example, we can choose $p = [4, 6, 7]$.

      In the third example, it is impossible to choose a subsequence of length $3$ that satisfies both of the conditions.
