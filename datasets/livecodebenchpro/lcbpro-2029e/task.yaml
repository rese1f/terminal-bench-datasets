      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2029E)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      For two integers $x$ and $y$ ($x,y\ge 2$), we will say that $x$ is a generator of $y$ if and only if $x$ can be transformed to $y$ by performing the following operation some number of times (possibly zero):

      - Choose a divisor $d$ ($d\ge 2$) of $x$, then increase $x$ by $d$.

      For example,

      - $3$ is a generator of $8$ since we can perform the following operations: $3 \xrightarrow{d = 3} 6 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 8$;
      - $4$ is a generator of $10$ since we can perform the following operations: $4 \xrightarrow{d = 4} 8 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 10$;
      - $5$ is not a generator of $6$ since we cannot transform $5$ into $6$ with the operation above.

      Now, Kevin gives you an array $a$ consisting of $n$ pairwise distinct integers ($a_i\ge 2$).

      You have to find an integer $x\ge 2$ such that for each $1\le i\le n$, $x$ is a generator of $a_i$, or determine that such an integer does not exist.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ ($1\le t\le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

      The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1\le n\le 10^5$) -- the length of the array $a$.

      The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ ($2\le a_i\le 4\cdot 10^5$) -- the elements in the array $a$. It is guaranteed that the elements are pairwise distinct.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output a single integer $x$ -- the integer you found. Print $-1$ if there does not exist a valid $x$.

      If there are multiple answers, you may output any of them.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      4

      3

      8 9 10

      4

      2 3 4 5

      2

      147 154

      5

      3 6 8 25 100000

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      2
      -1
      7
      3
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, for $x=2$:

      - $2$ is a generator of $8$, since we can perform the following operations: $2 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 4 \xrightarrow{d = 4} 8$;
      - $2$ is a generator of $9$, since we can perform the following operations: $2 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 4 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 6 \xrightarrow{d = 3} 9$.
      - $2$ is a generator of $10$, since we can perform the following operations: $2 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 4 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 6 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 8 \xrightarrow{d = 2} 10$.

      In the second test case, it can be proven that it is impossible to find a common generator of the four integers.
