      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2084C)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      You are given a permutation $a$ and $b$ of length $n$$^{\\text{∗}}$. You can perform the following operation at most $n$ times:

      - Choose two indices $i$ and $j$ ($1 \le i, j \le n$, $i \ne j$), swap $a_i$ with $a_j$, swap $b_i$ with $b_j$.

      Determine whether $a$ and $b$ can be reverses of each other after operations. In other words, for each $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$, $a_i = b_{n + 1 - i}$.

      If it is possible, output any valid sequence of operations. Otherwise, output $-1$.

      $^{\text{∗}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) -- the length of the permutations.

      The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$).

      The third line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ ($1 \le b_i \le n$).

      It is guaranteed that $a$ and $b$ are permutations of length $n$.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, if it is impossible, output $-1$ in the only line. Otherwise, output a single integer $m$ ($0 \le m \le n$) -- the number of operations in the first line. In the following $m$ lines, output two integers -- the indices $i$ and $j$ ($1 \le i, j \le n$, $i \ne j$) in each operation in order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      5

      2

      1 2

      1 2

      2

      1 2

      2 1

      4

      1 3 2 4

      2 4 1 3

      5

      2 5 1 3 4

      3 5 4 2 1

      5

      3 1 2 4 5

      1 2 3 4 5

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      -1
      0
      1
      1 2
      2
      1 2
      1 3
      -1
      ```

      ### Note

      In the second test case, $b$ is already the reverse of $a$.

      In the third test case, after performing the following operation, $b$ will become the reverse of $a$:

      - Swap $a_1, a_2$ and swap $b_1, b_2$. Now $a = [3, 1, 2, 4]$ and $b = [4, 2, 1, 3]$.

      In the fourth test case, after performing the following operations in order, $b$ will become the reverse of $a$:

      - Swap $a_1, a_2$ and swap $b_1, b_2$. Now $a = [5, 2, 1, 3, 4]$ and $b = [5, 3, 4, 2, 1]$.
      - Swap $a_1, a_3$ and swap $b_1, b_3$. Now $a = [1, 2, 5, 3, 4]$ and $b = [4, 3, 5, 2, 1]$.
