      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2056C)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      For an integer sequence $a = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n]$, we define $f(a)$ as the length of the longest subsequence$^{\text{∗}}$ of $a$ that is a palindrome$^{\text{†}}$.

      Let $g(a)$ represent the number of subsequences of length $f(a)$ that are palindromes. In other words, $g(a)$ counts the number of palindromic subsequences in $a$ that have the maximum length.

      Given an integer $n$, your task is to find any sequence $a$ of $n$ integers that satisfies the following conditions:

      - $1 \le a_i \le n$ for all $1 \le i \le n$.
      - $g(a) > n$

      It can be proven that such a sequence always exists under the given constraints.

      $^{\text{∗}}$A sequence $x$ is a subsequence of a sequence $y$ if $x$ can be obtained from $y$ by the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) element from arbitrary positions.

      $^{\text{†}}$A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same from left to right as from right to left. For example, $[1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1]$, $[5, 5, 5, 5]$, and $[4, 3, 3, 4]$ are palindromes, while $[1, 2]$ and $[2, 3, 3, 3, 3]$ are not.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($\color{red}{6} \le n \le 100$) -- the length of the sequence.

      Note that there are no constraints on the sum of $n$ over all test cases.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$, representing an array that satisfies the conditions.

      If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of them.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      3

      6

      9

      15

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      1 1 2 3 1 2
      7 3 3 7 5 3 7 7 3
      15 8 8 8 15 5 8 1 15 5 8 15 15 15 8
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first example, one possible solution is $a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]$. In this case, $f(a) = 3$ as the longest palindromic subsequence has length $3$. There are $7$ ways to choose a subsequence of length $3$ that is a palindrome, as shown below:

      1. $[a_1, a_2, a_5] = [1, 1, 1]$
      2. $[a_1, a_3, a_5] = [1, 2, 1]$
      3. $[a_1, a_4, a_5] = [1, 3, 1]$
      4. $[a_2, a_3, a_5] = [1, 2, 1]$
      5. $[a_2, a_4, a_5] = [1, 3, 1]$
      6. $[a_3, a_4, a_6] = [2, 3, 2]$
      7. $[a_3, a_5, a_6] = [2, 1, 2]$

      Therefore, $g(a) = 7$, which is greater than $n = 6$. Hence, $a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]$ is a valid solution.

      In the second example, one possible solution is $a = [7, 3, 3, 7, 5, 3, 7, 7, 3]$. In this case, $f(a) = 5$. There are $24$ ways to choose a subsequence of length $5$ that is a palindrome. Some examples are $[a_2, a_4, a_5, a_8, a_9] = [3, 7, 5, 7, 3]$ and $[a_1, a_4, a_6, a_7, a_8] = [7, 7, 3, 7, 7]$. Therefore, $g(a) = 24$, which is greater than $n = 9$. Hence, $a = [7, 3, 3, 7, 5, 3, 7, 7, 3]$ is a valid solution.

      In the third example, $f(a) = 7$ and $g(a) = 190$, which is greater than $n = 15$.
