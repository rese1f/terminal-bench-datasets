      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2036A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Boris Notkin composes melodies. He represents them as a sequence of notes, where each note is encoded as an integer from $0$ to $127$ inclusive. The interval between two notes $a$ and $b$ is equal to $|a - b|$ semitones.

      Boris considers a melody perfect if the interval between each two adjacent notes is either $5$ semitones or $7$ semitones.

      After composing his latest melodies, he enthusiastically shows you his collection of works. Help Boris Notkin understand whether his melodies are perfect.

      ### Input

      The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 1000$) -- the number of melodies.

      Each melody is described by two lines.

      The first line contains an integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 50$) -- the number of notes in the melody.

      The second line contains $n$ integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \dots, a_{n}$ ($0 \leq a_{i} \leq 127$) -- the notes of the melody.

      ### Output

      For each melody, output "YES", if it is perfect; otherwise, output "NO".

      You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.
