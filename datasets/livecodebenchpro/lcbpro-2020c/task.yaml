      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2020C)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      You are given three non-negative integers $b$, $c$, and $d$.

      Please find a non-negative integer $a \in [0, 2^{61}]$ such that $(a\, |\, b)-(a\, \&\, c)=d$, where $|$ and $\&$ denote the [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR) and the [bitwise AND operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#AND), respectively.

      If such an $a$ exists, print its value. If there is no solution, print a single integer $-1$. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^5$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The only line of each test case contains three positive integers $b$, $c$, and $d$ ($0 \le b, c, d \le 10^{18}$).

      ### Output

      For each test case, output the value of $a$, or $-1$ if there is no solution. Please note that $a$ must be non-negative and cannot exceed $2^{61}$.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      3

      2 2 2

      4 2 6

      10 2 14

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      0
      -1
      12
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, $(0\,|\,2)-(0\,\&\,2)=2-0=2$. So, $a = 0$ is a correct answer.

      In the second test case, no value of $a$ satisfies the equation.

      In the third test case, $(12\,|\,10)-(12\,\&\,2)=14-0=14$. So, $a = 12$ is a correct answer.
