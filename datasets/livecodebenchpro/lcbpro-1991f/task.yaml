      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 1991F)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      You are given $n$ sticks, numbered from $1$ to $n$. The length of the $i$-th stick is $a_i$.

      You need to answer $q$ queries. In each query, you are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \le l < r \le n$, $r - l + 1 \ge 6$). Determine whether it is possible to choose $6$ distinct sticks from the sticks numbered $l$ to $r$, to form $2$ non-degenerate triangles$^{\text{∗}}$.

      $^{\text{∗}}$A triangle with side lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ is called non-degenerate if:

      - $a < b + c$,
      - $b < a + c$, and
      - $c < a + b$.

      ### Input

      The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($6 \le n \le 10^5$, $1 \le q \le 10^5$) -- the number of sticks and the number of queries respectively.

      The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$) -- $a_i$ denotes the length of the $i$-th stick.

      Each of the following $q$ lines contains two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \le l < r \le n$, $r - l + 1 \ge 6$) -- the parameters of each query.

      ### Output

      For each query, output "YES" (without quotes) if it is possible to form $2$ triangles, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

      You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      10 5

      5 2 2 10 4 10 6 1 5 3

      1 6

      2 7

      2 8

      5 10

      4 10

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      YES
      NO
      YES
      NO
      YES
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first query, the lengths of the sticks are $[5, 2, 2, 10, 4, 10]$. Two sets of sticks $[2, 4, 5]$ and $[2, 10, 10]$ can be selected to form $2$ non-degenerate triangles.

      In the second query, the lengths of the sticks are $[2, 2, 10, 4, 10, 6]$. It can be shown that it is impossible to form $2$ non-degenerate triangles.

      In the third query, the lengths of the sticks are $[2, 2, 10, 4, 10, 6, 1]$. Two sets of sticks $[1, 2, 2]$ and $[4, 10, 10]$ can be selected to form $2$ non-degenerate triangles.

      In the fourth query, the lengths of the sticks are $[4, 10, 6, 1, 5, 3]$. It can be shown that it is impossible to form $2$ non-degenerate triangles.

      In the fifth query, the lengths of the sticks are $[10, 4, 10, 6, 1, 5, 3]$. Two sets of sticks $[1, 10, 10]$ and $[3, 4, 5]$ can be selected to form $2$ non-degenerate triangles.
