/**
 * @brief Solves a single test case of the problem.
 * 
 * The problem asks for the minimum number of operations to transform an array into a permutation
 * after sequentially setting elements to 0 based on query indices. An operation allows replacing
 * the value at index `j` with `j`.
 * 
 * The core idea is that the minimum number of operations needed after query `i` (where elements
 * at indices `d_1, ..., d_i` are set to 0) is equal to the total number of elements
 * in all cycles of the permutation graph that contain at least one of the indices `d_1, ..., d_i`.
 * 
 * The algorithm proceeds in three steps:
 * 1. Find the cycle decomposition of the initial permutation `p`. Each node `k` is mapped to a cycle ID,
 *    and the size of each cycle is recorded.
 * 2. Process the queries `d_1, ..., d_n` sequentially. For each query `d_i`, identify the cycle containing
 *    index `d_i`. If this cycle has not yet been marked as "affected", mark it and add its size to a
 *    running total `current_total_affected_size`.
 * 3. Store the value of `current_total_affected_size` after processing each query `i`. This value is the answer for query `i`.
 *    Finally, print all stored results.
