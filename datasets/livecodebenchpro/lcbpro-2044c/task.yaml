      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2044C)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Ball is the teacher in Paperfold University. The seats of his classroom are arranged in $2$ rows with $m$ seats each.

      Ball is teaching $a + b + c$ monkeys, and he wants to assign as many monkeys to a seat as possible. Ball knows that $a$ of them only want to sit in row $1$, $b$ of them only want to sit in row $2$, and $c$ of them have no preference. Only one monkey may sit in each seat, and each monkey's preference must be followed if it is seated.

      What is the maximum number of monkeys that Ball can seat?

      ### Input

      The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.

      Each test case contains four integers $m$, $a$, $b$, and $c$ ($1 \leq m, a, b, c \leq 10^8$).

      ### Output

      For each test case, output the maximum number of monkeys you can seat.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      5

      10 5 5 10

      3 6 1 1

      15 14 12 4

      1 1 1 1

      420 6 9 69

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      20
      5
      30
      2
      84
      ```

      ### Note

      In the second test case, $6$ monkeys want to sit in the front row, but only $3$ seats are available. The monkeys that have no preference and the monkeys who prefer sitting in the second row can sit in the second row together. Thus, the answer is $3+2=5$.
