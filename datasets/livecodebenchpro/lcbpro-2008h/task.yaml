      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2008H)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Sakurako will soon take a test. The test can be described as an array of integers $n$ and a task on it:

      Given an integer $x$, Sakurako can perform the following operation any number of times:

      - Choose an integer $i$ ($1\le i\le n$) such that $a_i\ge x$;
      - Change the value of $a_i$ to $a_i-x$.

      Using this operation any number of times, she must find the minimum possible median$^{\text{∗}}$ of the array $a$.

      Sakurako knows the array but does not know the integer $x$. Someone let it slip that one of the $q$ values of $x$ will be in the next test, so Sakurako is asking you what the answer is for each such $x$.

      $^{\text{∗}}$The median of an array of length $n$ is the element that stands in the middle of the sorted array (at the $\frac{n+2}{2}$-th position for even $n$, and at the $\frac{n+1}{2}$-th for odd)

      ### Input

      The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1\le t\le 10^4$)  -- the number of test cases.

      The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1\le n,q\le 10^5$)  -- the number of elements in the array and the number of queries.

      The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1\le a_i\le n$)  -- the elements of the array.

      The following $q$ lines each contain one integer $x$ ($1\le x\le n$).

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $10^5$. The same guarantee applies to the sum of $q$ across all test cases.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output $q$ integers  -- the answer for each query.

      ### Example
