      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 1996G)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      On Penacony, The Land of the Dreams, there exists $n$ houses and $n$ roads. There exists a road between house $i$ and $i+1$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n-1$ and a road between house $n$ and house $1$. All roads are bidirectional. However, due to the crisis on Penacony, the overseeing family has gone into debt and may not be able to maintain all roads.

      There are $m$ pairs of friendships between the residents of Penacony. If the resident living in house $a$ is friends with the resident living in house $b$, there must be a path between houses $a$ and $b$ through maintained roads.

      What is the minimum number of roads that must be maintained?

      ### Input

      The first line contains $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.

      The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($3 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$) -- the number of houses and the number of friendships.

      The next $m$ lines contain two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \leq a < b \leq n$) -- the resident in house $a$ is friends with the resident in house $b$. It is guaranteed all ($a, b$) are distinct.

      It is guaranteed the sum of $n$ and $m$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output an integer, the minimum number of roads that must be maintained.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      7

      8 3

      1 8

      2 7

      4 5

      13 4

      1 13

      2 12

      3 11

      4 10

      10 2

      2 3

      3 4

      10 4

      3 8

      5 10

      2 10

      4 10

      4 1

      1 3

      5 2

      3 5

      1 4

      5 2

      2 5

      1 3

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      4
      7
      2
      7
      2
      3
      3
      ```

      ### Note

      For the first test case, the following roads must be maintained:

      - $8 \leftarrow \rightarrow 1$
      - $7 \leftarrow \rightarrow 8$
      - $1 \leftarrow \rightarrow 2$
      - $4 \leftarrow \rightarrow 5$
