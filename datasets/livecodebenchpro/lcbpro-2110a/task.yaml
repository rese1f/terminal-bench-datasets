      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2110A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      In 2077, everything became fashionable among robots, even arrays...

      We will call an array of integers $a$ fashionable if $\min(a) + \max(a)$ is divisible by $2$ without a remainder, where $\min(a)$ -- the value of the minimum element of the array $a$, and $\max(a)$ -- the value of the maximum element of the array $a$.

      You are given an array of integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$. In one operation, you can remove any element from this array. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the array $a$ fashionable.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^3$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 50$) -- the size of the array $a$.

      The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 50$) -- the elements of the array $a$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output one integer -- the minimum number of operations required to make the array $a$ fashionable.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      6

      2

      5 2

      7

      3 1 4 1 5 9 2

      7

      2 7 4 6 9 11 5

      3

      1 2 1

      2

      2 1

      8

      8 6 3 6 4 1 1 6

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      1
      0
      2
      1
      1
      3
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, at least one element needs to be removed since $\min(a)+\max(a)=2+5=7$, and $7$ is not divisible by $2$. If any of the elements are removed, only one element will remain. Then $\max(a) + \min(a)$ will be divisible by $2$.

      In the second test case, nothing needs to be removed since $\min(a)+\max(a)=1+9=10$, and $10$ is divisible by $2$.

      In the third test case, you can remove the elements with values $2$ and $4$, then $\min(a)+\max(a)=5+11=16$, and $16$ is divisible by $2$.
