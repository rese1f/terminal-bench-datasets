      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2025B)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Recently, akshiM met a task that needed binomial coefficients to solve. He wrote a code he usually does that looked like this:

      ```
      for (int n = 0; n < N; n++) { // loop over n from 0 to N-1 (inclusive)

      C\[n\]\[0\] = 1;

      C\[n\]\[n\] = 1;

      for (int k = 1; k < n; k++) // loop over k from 1 to n-1 (inclusive)

      C\[n\]\[k\] = C\[n\]\[k - 1\] + C\[n - 1\]\[k - 1\];

      }

      ```

      Unfortunately, he made an error, since the right formula is the following:

      ```
      C\[n\]\[k\] = C\[n - 1\]\[k\] + C\[n - 1\]\[k - 1\]

      ```

      But his team member keblidA is interested in values that were produced using the wrong formula. Please help him to calculate these coefficients for $t$ various pairs $(n_i, k_i)$. Note that they should be calculated according to the first (wrong) formula.

      Since values $C[n_i][k_i]$ may be too large, print them modulo $10^9 + 7$.

      ### Input

      The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^5$)Â -- the number of pairs. Next, $t$ pairs are written in two lines.

      The second line contains $t$ integers $n_1, n_2, \dots, n_t$ ($2 \le n_i \le 10^5$).

      The third line contains $t$ integers $k_1, k_2, \dots, k_t$ ($1 \le k_i < n_i$).

      ### Output

      Print $t$ integers $C[n_i][k_i]$ modulo $10^9 + 7$.

      ### Example
