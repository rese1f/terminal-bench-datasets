      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2096C)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      You are the proud leader of a city in Ancient Berland. There are $n^2$ buildings arranged in a grid of $n$ rows and $n$ columns. The height of the building in row $i$ and column $j$ is $h_{i, j}$.

      The city is beautiful if no two adjacent by side buildings have the same height. In other words, it must satisfy the following:

      - There does not exist a position $(i, j)$ ($1 \leq i \leq n$, $1 \leq j \leq n - 1$) such that $h_{i, j} = h_{i, j + 1}$.
      - There does not exist a position $(i, j)$ ($1 \leq i \leq n - 1$, $1 \leq j \leq n$) such that $h_{i, j} = h_{i + 1, j}$.

      There are $n$ workers at company A, and $n$ workers at company B. Each worker can be hired at most once.

      It costs $a_i$ coins to hire worker $i$ at company A. After hiring, worker $i$ will:

      - Increase the heights of all buildings in row $i$ by $1$. In other words, increase $h_{i, 1}, h_{i, 2}, \ldots, h_{i, n}$ by $1$.

      It costs $b_j$ coins to hire worker $j$ at company B. After hiring, worker $j$ will:

      - Increase the heights of all buildings in column $j$ by $1$. In other words, increase $h_{1, j}, h_{2, j}, \ldots, h_{n, j}$ by $1$.

      Find the minimum number of coins needed to make the city beautiful, or report that it is impossible.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 1000$) -- the size of the grid.

      The $i$-th of the next $n$ lines of each test case contains $n$ integers $h_{i, 1}, h_{i, 2}, \ldots, h_{i, n}$ ($1 \le h_{i, j} \le 10^9$) -- the heights of the buildings in row $i$.

      The next line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$) -- the costs of hiring the workers at company A.

      The next line of each test case contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ ($1 \le b_j \le 10^9$) -- the costs of hiring the workers at company B.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $1000$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output a single integer -- the minimum number of coins needed, or $-1$ if it is impossible.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      4

      2

      1 2

      2 1

      6 8 3 1 1 4

      1 4 5 1 9 6

      7 1 1 6 8 2

      11 23 20 79 30 15

      15 83 73 57 34 63

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      0
      14
      -1
      183
      ```

      ### Note

      For the first test case, we can see that the city is already beautiful. Thus, the answer is $0$.

      For the second test case, we can hire worker $2$ from company A, worker $4$ from company A, and worker $4$ from company B:

      $1

      $$2$$

      1

      $$\color{red}2$$

      implies

      $$1$$

      2

      $$1$$

      color{red}3

      $$\color{red}3$$

      color{red}2

      $$\color{red}1$$

      color{red}2

      $$\color{red}4$$

      color{red}3

      $$\color{red}2$$

      color{red}4

      $$1$$

      2

      $$1$$

      color{red}1

      $$1$$

      2

      $$1$$

      color{red}2

      $$\color{red}1$$

      color{red}3

      $$\color{red}1$$

      color{red}2

      $$\color{red}2$$

      color{red}4

      $$\color{red}2$$

      color{red}4$

      The cost of hiring the workers is $2 + 4 + 8 = 14$. This is the minimum possible cost.

      For the third test case, no matter what we do, it is impossible to make the city beautiful. Thus, the answer is $-1$.
