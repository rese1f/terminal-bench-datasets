      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2026A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      You are given a coordinate plane and three integers $X$, $Y$, and $K$. Find two line segments $AB$ and $CD$ such that

      1. the coordinates of points $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ are integers;
      2. $0 \le A_x, B_x, C_x, D_x \le X$ and $0 \le A_y, B_y, C_y, D_y \le Y$;
      3. the length of segment $AB$ is at least $K$;
      4. the length of segment $CD$ is at least $K$;
      5. segments $AB$ and $CD$ are perpendicular: if you draw lines that contain $AB$ and $CD$, they will cross at a right angle.

      Note that it's not necessary for segments to intersect. Segments are perpendicular as long as the lines they induce are perpendicular.

      ### Input

      The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 5000$) -- the number of test cases. Next, $t$ cases follow.

      The first and only line of each test case contains three integers $X$, $Y$, and $K$ ($1 \le X, Y \le 1000$; $1 \le K \le 1414$).

      Additional constraint on the input: the values of $X$, $Y$, and $K$ are chosen in such a way that the answer exists.

      ### Output

      For each test case, print two lines. The first line should contain $4$ integers $A_x$, $A_y$, $B_x$, and $B_y$ -- the coordinates of the first segment.

      The second line should also contain $4$ integers $C_x$, $C_y$, $D_x$, and $D_y$ -- the coordinates of the second segment.

      If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      4

      1 1 1

      3 4 1

      4 3 3

      3 4 4

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      0 0 1 0
      0 0 0 1
      2 4 2 2
      0 1 1 1
      0 0 1 3
      1 2 4 1
      0 1 3 4
      0 3 3 0
      ```
