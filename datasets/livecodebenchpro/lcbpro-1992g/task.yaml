      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 1992G)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      K1o0n gave you an array $a$ of length $n$, consisting of numbers $1, 2, \ldots, n$. Accept it? Of course! But what to do with it? Of course, calculate $\text{MEOW}(a)$.

      Let $\text{MEX}(S, k)$ be the $k$-th positive (strictly greater than zero) integer in ascending order that is not present in the set $S$. Denote $\text{MEOW}(a)$ as the sum of $\text{MEX}(b, |b| + 1)$, over all distinct subsets $b$ of the array $a$.

      Examples of $\text{MEX}(S, k)$ values for sets:

      - $\text{MEX}(\{3,2\}, 1) = 1$, because $1$ is the first positive integer not present in the set;
      - $\text{MEX}(\{4,2,1\}, 2) = 5$, because the first two positive integers not present in the set are $3$ and $5$;
      - $\text{MEX}(\{\}, 4) = 4$, because there are no numbers in the empty set, so the first $4$ positive integers not present in it are $1, 2, 3, 4$.

      ### Input

      The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.

      In a single line of each test case, an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 5000$) is entered, the size of the array of gifted numbers.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n^2$ over all test cases does not exceed $25 \cdot 10^6$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output a single number -- $\text{MEOW}(a)$. Since it may be very large, output it modulo $10^9 + 7$.
