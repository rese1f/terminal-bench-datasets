      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2000D)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Vlad found a strip of $n$ cells, numbered from left to right from $1$ to $n$. In the $i$-th cell, there is a positive integer $a_i$ and a letter $s_i$, where all $s_i$ are either 'L' or 'R'.

      Vlad invites you to try to score the maximum possible points by performing any (possibly zero) number of operations.

      In one operation, you can choose two indices $l$ and $r$ ($1 \le l < r \le n$) such that $s_l$ = 'L' and $s_r$ = 'R' and do the following:

      - add $a_l + a_{l + 1} + \dots + a_{r - 1} + a_r$ points to the current score;
      - replace $s_i$ with '.' for all $l \le i \le r$, meaning you can no longer choose these indices.

      For example, consider the following strip:

      $3

      $$5$$

      1

      $$4$$

      3$$2$LRLLLR

      You can first choose $l = 1$, $r = 2$ and add $3 + 5 = 8$ to your score.

      $3

      $$5$$

      1

      $$4$$

      3$$2$..LLLR

      Then choose $l = 3$, $r = 6$ and add $1 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 10$ to your score.

      $3

      $$5$$

      1

      $$4$$

      3$$2$......

      As a result, it is impossible to perform another operation, and the final score is $18$.

      What is the maximum score that can be achieved?

      ### Input

      The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) -- the number of test cases.

      The first line of each test case contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) -- the length of the strip.

      The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^5$) -- the numbers written on the strip.

      The third line of each test case contains a string $s$ of $n$ characters 'L' and 'R'.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output one integer -- the maximum possible number of points that can be scored.

      ### Example
