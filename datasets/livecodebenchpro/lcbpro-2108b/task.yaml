      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2108B)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      On a recent birthday, your best friend Maurice gave you a pair of numbers $n$ and $x$, and asked you to construct an array of positive numbers $a$ of length $n$ such that $a_1 \oplus a_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus a_n = x$ $^{\text{∗}}$.

      This task seemed too simple to you, and therefore you decided to give Maurice a return gift by constructing an array among all such arrays that has the smallest sum of its elements. You immediately thought of a suitable array; however, since writing it down turned out to be too time-consuming, Maurice will have to settle for just the sum of its elements.

      $^{\\text{∗}}$$\\oplus$ denotes the [bitwise XOR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.

      Each test case consists of a single line containing a pair of numbers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \le n \le 10^9, \; 0 \le x \le 10^9$) -- the numbers given to you by Maurice.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output your gift to Maurice -- the sum of the elements of the array that satisfies all the described properties. If a suitable array does not exist, output $-1$.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      8

      2 1

      3 6

      1 0

      2 0

      5 0

      2 27

      15 43

      12345678 9101112

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      5
      8
      -1
      2
      8
      27
      55
      21446778
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, one of the suitable arrays is $[2, 3]$. It can be shown that it is impossible to achieve a smaller sum of array elements.

      In the second case, one of the suitable arrays is $[1, 3, 4]$. It can also be shown that this is the optimal amount.
