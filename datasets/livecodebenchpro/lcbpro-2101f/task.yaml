      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2101F)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      You are given a tree with $n$ vertices, where each vertex can be colored red, blue, or white. The coolness of a coloring is defined as the maximum distance$^{\text{∗}}$ between a red and a blue vertex.

      Formally, if we denote the color of the $i$-th vertex as $c_i$, the coolness of a coloring is $\max d(u, v)$ over all pairs of vertices $1\le u, v\le n$ where $c_u$ is red and $c_v$ is blue. If there are no red or no blue vertices, the coolness is zero.

      Your task is to calculate the sum of coolness over all $3^n$ possible colorings of the tree, modulo $998\,244\,353$.

      $^{\text{∗}}$The distance between two vertices $a$ and $b$ in a tree is equal to the number of edges on the unique simple path between vertex $a$ and vertex $b$.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 50$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2\le n\le 3000$) -- the number of vertices in the tree.

      Each of the next $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1\le u, v\le n$) -- the endpoints of the edges of the tree.

      It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $3000$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output the sum of coolness over all $3^n$ possible colorings of the tree, modulo $998\,244\,353$.

      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, there are $12$ colorings that have at least one blue and one red node. The following pictures show their coloring and their coolness:

      ![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/15dd2aaf8c69f02fa71a455d40f5b7dc08ca4311.png)All these colorings have coolness $2$![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/921c5954be27aa779f596f91411b63f11d4f661a.png)All these colorings have coolness $1$

      Therefore, the sum of coolness over all possible colorings is $6\cdot 2 + 6\cdot 1 = 18$.

      In the second test case, the following are some examples of colorings with a coolness of $3$:
