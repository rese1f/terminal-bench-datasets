      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2014G)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      What is done is done, and the spoilt milk cannot be helped.

      Little John is as little as night is day -- he was known to be a giant, at possibly $2.1$ metres tall. It has everything to do with his love for milk.

      His dairy diary has $n$ entries, showing that he acquired $a_i$ pints of fresh milk on day $d_i$. Milk declines in freshness with time and stays drinkable for a maximum of $k$ days. In other words, fresh milk acquired on day $d_i$ will be drinkable between days $d_i$ and $d_i+k-1$ inclusive.

      Every day, Little John drinks drinkable milk, up to a maximum of $m$ pints. In other words, if there are less than $m$ pints of milk, he will drink them all and not be satisfied; if there are at least $m$ pints of milk, he will drink exactly $m$ pints and be satisfied, and it's a milk satisfaction day.

      Little John always drinks the freshest drinkable milk first.

      Determine the number of milk satisfaction days for Little John.

      ### Input

      The first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ ($1\leq t \leq 10^4$), the number of test cases.

      The first line of each test case consists of three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n$, $m$, $k \le 10^5$), the number of diary entries, the maximum pints needed for a milk satisfaction day, and the duration of milk's freshness.

      Then follow $n$ lines of each test case, each with two integers $d_i$ and $a_i$ ($1\le d_i$, $a_i \le 10^6$), the day on which the milk was acquired and the number of pints acquired. They are sorted in increasing values of $d_i$, and all values of $d_i$ are distinct.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output a single integer, the number of milk satisfaction days.

      ### Example

      10
      6
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, $5$ pints of milk are good for $3$ days before spoiling.

      In the second test case, the following will happen:

      - On day $1$, he will receive $5$ pints of milk and drink $3$ of them (leaving $2$ pints from day $1$);
      - On day $2$, he will receive $7$ pints of milk and drink $3$ of them (leaving $2$ pints from day $1$ and $4$ pints from day $2$);
      - On day $3$, he will drink $3$ pints from day $2$ (leaving $2$ pints from day $1$ and $1$ pint from day $2$);
      - On day $4$, the milk acquired on day $1$ will spoil, and he will drink $1$ pint from day $2$ (no more milk is left).
