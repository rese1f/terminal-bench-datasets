      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2002A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      You received an $n\times m$ grid from a mysterious source. The source also gave you a magic positive integer constant $k$.

      The source told you to color the grid with some colors, satisfying the following condition:

      - If $(x_1,y_1)$, $(x_2,y_2)$ are two distinct cells with the same color, then $\max(|x_1-x_2|,|y_1-y_2|)\ge k$.

      You don't like using too many colors. Please find the minimum number of colors needed to color the grid.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1\le t\le1000$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The only line of each test case consists of three positive integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n,m,k\le10^4$) -- the dimensions of the grid and the magic constant.

      ### Output

      For each test case, print a single integer -- the minimum number of colors needed to color the grid.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      6

      3 3 2

      5 1 10000

      7 3 4

      3 2 7

      8 9 6

      2 5 4

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      4
      5
      12
      6
      36
      8
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, one of the optimal constructions is:

      In the second test case, the color of all cells must be pairwise different, so the answer is $5$.
