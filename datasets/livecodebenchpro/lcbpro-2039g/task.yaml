      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2039G)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Shohag has a tree with $n$ nodes.

      Pebae has an integer $m$. She wants to assign each node a value -- an integer from $1$ to $m$. So she asks Shohag to count the number, modulo $998\,244\,353$, of assignments such that following conditions are satisfied:

      - For each pair $1 \le u \lt v \le n$, the [least common multiple (LCM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_common_multiple) of the values of the nodes in the unique simple path from $u$ to $v$ is not divisible by the number of nodes in the path.
      - The [greatest common divisor (GCD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the values of all nodes from $1$ to $n$ is $1$.

      But this problem is too hard for Shohag to solve. As Shohag loves Pebae, he has to solve the problem. Please save Shohag!

      ### Input

      The first line contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n \le 10^6$, $1 \le m \le 10^{9}$).

      Each of the next $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u, v \le n$) indicating there is an edge between vertices $u$ and $v$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.

      ### Output

      Print a single integer -- the number of valid ways to assign each vertex a value, modulo $998\,244\,353$.

      ### Examples

      #### Input #1

      ```

      #### Input #3

      ```

      12 69

      3 5

      1 4

      2 3

      4 5

      5 6

      8 9

      12 1

      ```

      #### Output #3

      ```
      444144548
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first test case, the valid assignments are $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$ and $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 5]$.

      In the second test case, the valid assignments are $[1, 1]$, $[1, 3]$, $[1, 5]$, $[3, 1]$, $[3, 5]$, $[5, 1]$ and $[5, 3]$.
