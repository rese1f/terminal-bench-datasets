      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2093A)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      We call an array $a$, consisting of $k$ positive integers, palindromic if $[a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k] = [a_k, a_{k-1}, \dots, a_1]$. For example, the arrays $[1, 2, 1]$ and $[5, 1, 1, 5]$ are palindromic, while the arrays $[1, 2, 3]$ and $[21, 12]$ are not.

      We call a number $k$ an ideal generator if any integer $n$ ($n \ge k$) can be represented as the sum of the elements of a palindromic array of length exactly $k$. Each element of the array must be greater than $0$.

      For example, the number $1$ is an ideal generator because any natural number $n$ can be generated using the array $[n]$. However, the number $2$ is not an ideal generator -- there is no palindromic array of length $2$ that sums to $3$.

      Determine whether the given number $k$ is an ideal generator.

      ### Input

      The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) -- the number of test cases.

      The first and only line of each test case contains one integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 1000$).

      ### Output

      For each number $k$, you need to output the word "YES" if it is an ideal generator, or "NO" otherwise.

      You may output "Yes" and "No" in any case (for example, the strings "yES", "yes", and "Yes" will be recognized as a positive answer).

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      5

      1

      2

      3

      73

      1000

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      YES
      NO
      YES
      YES
      NO
      ```
