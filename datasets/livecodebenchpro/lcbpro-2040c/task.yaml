      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2040C)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      Consider a permutation$^{\text{∗}}$ $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ of integers from $1$ to $n$. We can introduce the following sum for it$^{\text{†}}$:



      $$S(p) = \sum_{1 \le l \le r \le n} \min(p_l, p_{l + 1}, \ldots, p_r)$$

      Let us consider all permutations of length $n$ with the maximum possible value of $S(p)$. Output the $k$-th of them in lexicographical$^{\text{‡}}$order, or report that there are less than $k$ of them.

      $^{\text{∗}}$A permutation of length $n$ is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array), and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).

      $^{\text{†}}$For example:

      - For the permutation $[1, 2, 3]$ the value of $S(p)$ is equal to $\min(1) + \min(1, 2) + \min(1, 2, 3) + \min(2) + \min(2, 3) + \min(3) =$ $1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10$
      - For the permutation $[2, 4, 1, 3]$ the value of $S(p)$ is equal to $\min(2) + \min(2, 4) + \min(2, 4, 1) + \min(2, 4, 1, 3) \ +$ $ \min(4) + \min(4, 1) + \min(4, 1, 3) \ +$ $\min(1) + \min(1, 3) \ +$ $\min(3) =$ $2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 17$.

      $^{\text{‡}}$An array $a$ is lexicographically smaller than an array $b$ if and only if one of the following holds:

      - $a$ is a prefix of $b$, but $a \ne b$; or
      - in the first position where $a$ and $b$ differ, the array $a$ has a smaller element than the corresponding element in $b$.

      ### Input

      Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.

      The only line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$; $1 \le k \le 10^{12}$) -- the length of the permutation and the index number of the desired permutation.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10 ^ 5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, if there are less than $k$ suitable permutations, print $-1$.

      Otherwise, print the $k$-th suitable permutation.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      6

      3 2

      3 3

      4 11

      4 6

      6 39

      7 34

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      1 3 2
      2 3 1
      -1
      2 4 3 1
      -1
      2 3 4 5 7 6 1
      ```

      ### Note

      Let us calculate the required sum for all permutations of length $3$ (ordered lexicographically):

      PermutationValue of $S(p)

      $$[1, 2, 3]$$

      10

      $$[1, 3, 2]$$

      10

      $$[2, 1, 3]$$

      9

      $$[2, 3, 1]$$

      10

      $$[3, 1, 2]$$

      9

      $$[3, 2, 1]$$

      10$

      In the first test case, you have to print the second suitable permutation of length $3$. Looking at the table, we see that it is the permutation $[1, 3, 2]$.

      In the second test case, you have to print the third suitable permutation of length $3$. Looking at the table, we see that it is the permutation $[2, 3, 1]$.
