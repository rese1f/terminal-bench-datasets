      LiveCodeBench Pro (Mini) - external judge.

      The agent must create a C++17 solution file at /app/main.cpp.
      This task does not include local test cases. Instead, the test harness:
        1) POSTs the code to the external judge (/submit) to get a sid,
        2) polls GET /result/{sid}?short=1 until status == "done",
        3) passes only if the judge returns passed == true.

      Environment variables (overridable at runtime):
        - BASE_URL: judge base URL (default http://38.80.122.117:8081)
        - PID: problem id (default 2050C)
        - LANG: language (default cpp)
        - CODE_PATH: path to code (default /app/main.cpp)
        - JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SECS: poll timeout seconds (default 120)

      You are given a number $n$ with a length of no more than $10^5$.

      You can perform the following operation any number of times: choose one of its digits, square it, and replace the original digit with the result. The result must be a digit (that is, if you choose the digit $x$, then the value of $x^2$ must be less than $10$).

      Is it possible to obtain a number that is divisible by $9$ through these operations?

      ### Input

      The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$)Â -- the number of test cases.

      The only line of each test case contains the number $n$, without leading zeros. The length of the number does not exceed $10^5$.

      It is guaranteed that the sum of the lengths of the numbers across all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.

      ### Output

      For each test case, output "YES" if it is possible to obtain a number divisible by $9$ using the described operations, and "NO" otherwise.

      You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive answer.

      ### Example

      #### Input #1

      ```

      9

      123

      322

      333333333333

      9997

      5472778912773

      1234567890

      23

      33

      52254522632

      ```

      #### Output #1

      ```
      NO
      YES
      YES
      NO
      NO
      YES
      NO
      YES
      YES
      ```

      ### Note

      In the first example, from the integer $123$, it is possible to obtain only $123$, $143$, $129$, and $149$, none of which are divisible by $9$.

      In the second example, you need to replace the second digit with its square; then $n$ will equal $342 = 38 \cdot 9$.

      In the third example, the integer is already divisible by $9$.
